                "IntroductionSustainabilityDriving Climate SolutionsCarbonPeopleAppendix\nThe Climate Pledge\nThe Climate Pledge is a commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge with Global Optimism in 2019 and became the first company to sign on.\nThe Climate Pledge brings together the world\u2019s top companies to accelerate joint action, cross-sector collaboration, and responsible change. Signatories agree to three areas of action:\n\u2022\nRegular reporting: Measure and report on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a regular basis.\n\u2022\nCarbon elimination: Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through business change and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon-emission-elimination strategies.\n\u2022\nCredible offsets: Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.\nWhile each company will take its own path to net zero, signing The Climate Pledge reinforces their commitment to sustainability.\nProgress in 2022\nAs of 2022 year end, The Climate Pledge signatories represent:\n396 Signatories\n36 Countries\n55 Industries\n9.3M+ Employees\n$3.68T In global annual revenue\nWe have set a goal to recruit additional signatories every year. In 2022 alone, 111 companies signed The Climate Pledge. We also facilitated signatory collaboration to tackle hard-to-abate emissions while providing The Climate Pledge community with helpful information and partnerships to drive forward multisectoral decarbonization initiatives.\nLearn more about The Climate Pledge .\nThe Climate Pledge Fund\nThe Climate Pledge Fund is a $2 billion venture investment program supporting the advancement of sustainable technologies and services that will enable Amazon to meet our net-zero carbon goal. Throughout 2022, The Climate Pledge Fund continued its mission to support companies working on promising decarbonization solutions.\nWe made new investments in seven companies: Electric Hydrogen, Sunfire, and Verne, which are developing green hydrogen production and storage methods;2 Moxion Power and Ambient Photonics, which are advancing cleaner energy storage; and Brimstone and Electra, which are working to decarbonize construction. These investments bring our portfolio to 20 total companies as of the end of 2022.\nEquitably Scaling Climate Tech Solutions\nWomen-founded companies typically receive a fraction of the total venture capital flowing into climate tech startups.3 In November 2022, Amazon made a $53 million commitment to help address this gender inequity. This includes a $50 million commitment through The Climate Pledge Fund\u2019s new Female Founder Initiative to invest in women-founded and women-led climate tech companies. Amazon also committed $3 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Climate Gender Equity Fund. As a co-founder of The Climate Pledge, Amazon will work with Pledge signatories and other companies to encourage their additional support and corporate investment in the Climate Gender Equity Fund.\nThrough The Climate Pledge Fund, we invest in companies\u2014like electric aircraft innovator BETA Technologies\u2014that are developing low-carbon solutions.\nIn 2022, Amazon became a founding member of the Climate Resolute Coalition, a multistakeholder organization focused on advancing women\u2019s economic empowerment and climate solutions in global supply chains. We also work with various other organizations to enhance equitable opportunities for climate tech entrepreneurs, including Greentown Labs and Elemental Excelerator. 2022 Amazon Sustainability Report 14\n|"
