Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage\nimmuno-oncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a\nprice of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned\nsubsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium\u2019s lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that\nis designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the\ngross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired\nIPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is\npresented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily\nconsisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and\ncommercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The\ntotal fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to\nArray employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded\nin Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the\nbalance with existing cash.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___Therachon\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare\ndiseases, with assets in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb\ndwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470 million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in\nthe development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset\nrepresented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was\n$322 million, which consisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset\nacquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and development expenses."
