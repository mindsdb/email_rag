And the fact that coronavirus keeps spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests this strain might not succumb to warmer temperatures. \n \u201cThe short answer is that while we may expect modest declines in the contagiousness of (novel coronavirus) in warmer, wetter weather and perhaps with the closing of schools \u2026 it is not reasonable to expect these declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent,\u201d wrote Dr. Marc Lipsitch, director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard\u2019s T.H.

Rather, it\u2019s to protect others from yourself if you\u2019re sick or you\u2019re an asymptomatic carrier. \u201cThis is more for people who might be infected and don\u2019t know it, and to try and lower the likelihood that they will spread this to somebody else,\u201d CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.

Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face \u2014 a common way that coronavirus spreads.\n It\u2019s important to wash your cloth mask after every use.

Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news. \n\n\n \nYou can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:\n\n\n \nRegularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. \n\n\n\nMaintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. \n\n\n\nAvoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick. \n\n\n\nMake sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. \n\n\n\nStay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. \n\n\n \nCalling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections. \n\n\n \nKeep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places \u2013 especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.",

It gives 12 weeks of paid leave to people caring for children whose schools are closed or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the coronavirus.  Many workers at small and midsize companies and nonprofits can get the paid leave, as can government employees, as long as they\u2019ve been employed at least 30 days. The law includes people who don\u2019t typically get such benefits, like part-time and gig economy workers. But it excludes those at companies with more than 500 people, including many front-line employees at many major retailers and fast-food restaurants.  Workers at places with fewer than 50 employees are included, but the Labor Department could exempt small businesses if providing leave would put them out of business.

Recognize your own agency and start taking care of the common-sense precautionary measures that are within your control, like stocking up on a [couple of extra weeks\u2019 supply](https://www.ready.gov/pandemic) of food or medication.  Maintaining social connection, despite physical distance, is also important. Reach out to others via phone calls, emails or video chats, and talk through the feelings you\u2019re experiencing. It\u2019s important to be gentle with yourself, and maintain any kind of routine you can to have a sense of stability. Practice self-care, whether that means doing an at-home workout, baking, maintaining a regular religious practice or journaling. Focusing on these things can help bring some peace of mind.

Those plans relied on the ability to gather lawmakers in a safe place together, however \u2014 a hazard during a pandemic.  \"There's no serious effort to grapple with what could happen in the event of a major catastrophe,\" said Norm Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who pushed for plans in the wake of Sept. 11. He said that a bill to allow remote voting during a national crisis, put forward by Senators Rob Portman and Richard Durbin, was \"a good start.\"  So far, congressional leaders have [resisted calls for remote voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/coronavirus-congress- voting.html), calling it a bad precedent and saying they need to address the current crisis. They have instead looked for ways to practice social distancing within the Capitol. \"There's reason to be wary about a virtual Congress,\" Mr. Ornstein said, like ensuring cybersecurity and that Americans can still see and hear lawmakers at work.  But he added that House and Senate leaders, through legislation or rule changes, could create the capacity for remote voting only in the most extreme circumstances, such as when many members are incapacitated or transportation to the Capitol or an alternate meeting place becomes impossible.",

Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n\n 2: Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.\n\n 3: Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.\n\n 4: Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.\n\n 5: Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.\n\n 6: Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places - especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.",

The CDC found traces of the virus' RNA, not the coronavirus itself, on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship \u2013 17 days after passengers had left the cabins.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that you can become infected if you touch your face after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, according to the CDC. But scientists don't think surfaces are the main way that the virus spreads; the most common form of infection is from respiratory droplets spread by a person's cough or sneeze, the CDC reports.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the WHO says it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, traveled and exposed to different conditions and temperatures. That means the virus cannot spread through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting coronavirus cases.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the WHO is reportedly encouraging people to use as many digital payment options as possible.
