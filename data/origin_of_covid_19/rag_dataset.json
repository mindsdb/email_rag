SARS-CoV, a previously unknown \u03b2-coronavirus, emerged in China 18 years ago and spread to 29 other countries, causing a near-pandemic and killing 813 people. It has not been seen since.

However, it does not efficiently transmit between humans and has been largely limited to the Middle East where its intermediary host, the dromedary camel, is present.

            "reference_answer": "Zoonotic diseases, including coronaviruses, can transmit from animals to humans through various mechanisms. Factors and behaviors that increase the risk of zoonotic spillover include:\n\n1. Direct contact with infected animals: Close contact with infected animals, such as through handling, hunting, or consuming them, can lead to transmission of zoonotic diseases. For example, in the case of coronaviruses, it is believed that the initial spillover event occurred through direct contact with infected bats or other wildlife.\n\n2. Consumption of infected animal products: Consuming meat, organs, or other animal products from infected animals can also lead to zoonotic transmission. This is particularly relevant in the case of certain cultures or regions where the consumption of wildlife or exotic animals is common.\n\n3. Occupational exposure: People who work closely with animals, such as farmers, veterinarians, or wildlife handlers, are at an increased risk of zoonotic spillover. Occupational exposure can occur through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids.\n\n4. Wildlife trade and trafficking: The global trade and trafficking of wildlife can contribute to the spread of zoonotic diseases. Animals captured and transported under stressful conditions can become more susceptible to infections, increasing the likelihood of spillover events.\n\n5. Environmental factors: Environmental changes, such as deforestation, urbanization, and climate change, can disrupt ecosystems and bring humans into closer contact with wildlife. This can create opportunities for zoonotic spillover by increasing the interactions between humans and animals.\n\n6. Genetic factors: The genetic makeup of both the host animal and the virus can influence the likelihood of zoonotic transmission. Certain genetic characteristics of the virus may allow it to infect and replicate in human cells, while genetic factors in the host animal may affect its susceptibility to infection.\n\nIt is important to note that these factors and behaviors can vary depending on the specific zoonotic disease and the ecological context in which it occurs. Understanding and addressing these factors is crucial for preventing and controlling zoonotic spillover events.",

            "reference_answer": "The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic cats can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 by allowing the virus to be transmitted from cats to humans. This means that if a cat is infected with the virus, it can potentially pass it on to humans through close contact or respiratory droplets. This can lead to human-to-human transmission and further spread of the virus within the population.",
