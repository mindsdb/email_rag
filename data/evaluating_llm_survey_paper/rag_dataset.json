                "1 Introduction\nWhen we delve into the concept of intelligence, human intelligence naturally emerges as\nour benchmark. Over millennia, humanity has embarked on a continuous exploration of\nhuman intelligence, employing diverse methods for measurement and evaluation. This quest\nfor understanding intelligence encompasses an array of approaches, ranging from IQ tests\nand cognitive games to educational pursuits and professional accomplishments. Throughout\nhistory, our persistent efforts have been geared toward comprehending, assessing, and pushing\nthe boundaries of various facets of human intelligence.\nHowever, against the backdrop of the information age, a new dimension of intelligence is\nemerging, sparking widespread interest among scientists and researchers: machine intelligence.\nOne representative of this emerging field is language models in natural language processing\n(NLP). These language models, typically constructed using powerful deep neural networks,\npossess unprecedented language comprehension and generation capabilities. The question\nof how to measure and assess the level of this new type of intelligence has become a crucial\nissue.\nIn the nascent stages of NLP, researchers have commonly employed a set of straightforward\nbenchmark tests to evaluate their language models. These initial evaluations primarily\nconcentrate on aspects such as grammar and vocabulary, encompassing tasks like syntactic\nparsing, word sense disambiguation, and so on. In the early 1990s, the advent of the\nMUC evaluation (Grishman & Sundheim, 1996) has marked a significant milestone in the\nNLP community. The MUC evaluation primarily centers on information extraction tasks,\nchallenging participants to extract specific information from text. This evaluation framework\nplays a pivotal role in propelling the field of information extraction forward. Subsequently,\nwith the emergence of deep learning in the 2010s, the NLP community embraces more\nexpansive benchmarks like SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\nThese benchmarks not only evaluate system performance but also provide ample data for\ntraining systems. They usually assign individual scores to models according to the adopted\nevaluation metrics, facilitating the measurement of task-specific accuracy.\nWith the emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models, exemplified by BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019), evaluation methods have gradually evolved to adapt to the performance\nassessment of these new types of general models. In response to this paradigm shift, the NLP\ncommunity has taken the initiative to orchestrate a myriad of shared tasks and challenges,\nincluding but not limited to SemEval (Nakov et al., 2019), CoNLL (Sang & Meulder, 2003),\nGLUE (Wang et al., 2019b), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), and XNLI (Conneau et al.,\n2018). These endeavors entail aggregating scores for each model, offering a holistic measure\nof its overall performance. They have, in turn, fostered continuous refinement in NLP\nevaluation methodologies, creating a dynamic arena for researchers to compare and contrast\nthe capabilities of diverse systems.\nWith the continual expansion in the size of language models, large language models (LLMs)\nhave exhibited noteworthy performance under both zero- and few-shot settings, rivaling\nfine-tuned pre-trained models. This shift has precipitated a transformation in the evaluation\nlandscape, marking a departure from traditional task-centered benchmarks to a focus on\n4"

                "1 Introduction\nWhen we delve into the concept of intelligence, human intelligence naturally emerges as\nour benchmark. Over millennia, humanity has embarked on a continuous exploration of\nhuman intelligence, employing diverse methods for measurement and evaluation. This quest\nfor understanding intelligence encompasses an array of approaches, ranging from IQ tests\nand cognitive games to educational pursuits and professional accomplishments. Throughout\nhistory, our persistent efforts have been geared toward comprehending, assessing, and pushing\nthe boundaries of various facets of human intelligence.\nHowever, against the backdrop of the information age, a new dimension of intelligence is\nemerging, sparking widespread interest among scientists and researchers: machine intelligence.\nOne representative of this emerging field is language models in natural language processing\n(NLP). These language models, typically constructed using powerful deep neural networks,\npossess unprecedented language comprehension and generation capabilities. The question\nof how to measure and assess the level of this new type of intelligence has become a crucial\nissue.\nIn the nascent stages of NLP, researchers have commonly employed a set of straightforward\nbenchmark tests to evaluate their language models. These initial evaluations primarily\nconcentrate on aspects such as grammar and vocabulary, encompassing tasks like syntactic\nparsing, word sense disambiguation, and so on. In the early 1990s, the advent of the\nMUC evaluation (Grishman & Sundheim, 1996) has marked a significant milestone in the\nNLP community. The MUC evaluation primarily centers on information extraction tasks,\nchallenging participants to extract specific information from text. This evaluation framework\nplays a pivotal role in propelling the field of information extraction forward. Subsequently,\nwith the emergence of deep learning in the 2010s, the NLP community embraces more\nexpansive benchmarks like SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\nThese benchmarks not only evaluate system performance but also provide ample data for\ntraining systems. They usually assign individual scores to models according to the adopted\nevaluation metrics, facilitating the measurement of task-specific accuracy.\nWith the emergence of large-scale pre-trained language models, exemplified by BERT (Devlin\net al., 2019), evaluation methods have gradually evolved to adapt to the performance\nassessment of these new types of general models. In response to this paradigm shift, the NLP\ncommunity has taken the initiative to orchestrate a myriad of shared tasks and challenges,\nincluding but not limited to SemEval (Nakov et al., 2019), CoNLL (Sang & Meulder, 2003),\nGLUE (Wang et al., 2019b), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), and XNLI (Conneau et al.,\n2018). These endeavors entail aggregating scores for each model, offering a holistic measure\nof its overall performance. They have, in turn, fostered continuous refinement in NLP\nevaluation methodologies, creating a dynamic arena for researchers to compare and contrast\nthe capabilities of diverse systems.\nWith the continual expansion in the size of language models, large language models (LLMs)\nhave exhibited noteworthy performance under both zero- and few-shot settings, rivaling\nfine-tuned pre-trained models. This shift has precipitated a transformation in the evaluation\nlandscape, marking a departure from traditional task-centered benchmarks to a focus on\n4"

As LLMs are deployed in more applications, it is\ncrucial to rigorously assess their strengths and limitations across a diverse range of tasks and\ndatasets. In this section, we aim to offer a comprehensive overview of the evaluation methods\nand benchmarks pertinent to LLMs, spanning various capabilities such as question answering,\nknowledge completion, reasoning, and tool use.

                "4.1 Ethics and Morality\nThe ethics and morality evaluation of LLMs aims to assess whether LLMs have the ethical\nvalue alignment ablility, and whether they generate content that potentially deviates from\nethical standards. While there are considerable variations in criteria for determining moral\ncategories, we categorize current evaluations into four macroscopic perspectives based on\ntheir respective criteria.\nEvaluation with Expert-defined Ethics and Morality Expert-defined ethics and\nmorality refers to ethics and morality categorized by experts, usually proposed in academic\nbooks and articles. The earliest ethics and morality categories can trace back to Moral\nFoundation Theory (MFT) (Graham et al., 2009). MFT devides the moral principles into\nfive categories, each of which contains positive and negative perspectives. MFT generally\nbecome a cornerstone of related datasets. These datasets focus on ethics and morality in\ndifferent fields, such as politics (Johnson & Goldwasser, 2018), social sciences (Forbes et al.,\n2020), social media (Hoover et al., 2020). Rather than simply using yes/no to classify a scene\nor paragraph into one of the ten moral foundations proposed by MFT, Social Chemistry\n101 (Forbes et al., 2020) and Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (Hoover et al., 2020) use\na multi-dimensional metric to determine the categories. Social Chemistry 101 dissolves\nsocial norms into 12 dimensions, which contain moral foundations proposed in MFT. Moral\nStroies (Emelin et al., 2021) is a crowd-sourced dataset containing 12K short narratives\nfor goal-oriented moral reasoning grounded in social situations, genreated on social norms\nextracted from Social Chemistry 101 but ignoring controversial or value-neutral entries. Moral\nFoundations Dictionary (MFD) (Rezapour et al., 2019) is proposed on the foundation of\nMFT, and extended by Hopp et al. (2021) because MFD restricts the utility of certain words\nin expressing and understanding moral messages and natural variations of their meaning.\nIn evaluating LLMs, TrustGPT (Huang et al., 2023b) proposes a method to evaluate the\nethical and moral alignment of LLMs, which adopts two ways: active value alignment (AVA)\nand passive value alignment (PVA). The used dataset is Social Chemistry 101. The evaluation\nmetric for AVA is soft and hard accuracy due to the variations in human evaluation when\nconsidering the same object, while the metric for PVA is the proportion of cases where LLMs\nrefuse to answer. Results on TrustGPT show that on AVA, LLMs evaluated perform well\non soft accuracy compared to hard accuracy. It can also be concluded that LLMs evaluated\nhave certain judgment ability for social norms since the hard precision is above 0.5. However,\nthe performance on PVA is not good. ETHICS (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) is proposed based\non previous works which focus on various principles for narrow applications (Kitaev et al.,\n2020; Achiam & Amodei, 2019; Roller et al., 2021; Christiano et al., 2017) and reorganizes\nfive dimensions which are justice, deontology, virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and commonsense\nmoral judgements. 0/1-loss is used in the experiments of evaluating LLMs on ETHICS.\nEvaluation with Crowdsourced Ethics and Morality Ethics and Morality defined in\nthis way are all established by crowdsourced workers, who judge ethics and morality without\nprofessional guidance or training, only through their own preference. Botzer et al. (2021) focus\non analyzing moral judgements rendered on social media by capturing the moral judgements\nwhich are passed in the subreddit /r/AmITheAsshole on Reddit. The labels of the collected\ndata in their work are determined entirely by public voting in the social media community.\n22"

                "4.1 Ethics and Morality\nThe ethics and morality evaluation of LLMs aims to assess whether LLMs have the ethical\nvalue alignment ablility, and whether they generate content that potentially deviates from\nethical standards. While there are considerable variations in criteria for determining moral\ncategories, we categorize current evaluations into four macroscopic perspectives based on\ntheir respective criteria.\nEvaluation with Expert-defined Ethics and Morality Expert-defined ethics and\nmorality refers to ethics and morality categorized by experts, usually proposed in academic\nbooks and articles. The earliest ethics and morality categories can trace back to Moral\nFoundation Theory (MFT) (Graham et al., 2009). MFT devides the moral principles into\nfive categories, each of which contains positive and negative perspectives. MFT generally\nbecome a cornerstone of related datasets. These datasets focus on ethics and morality in\ndifferent fields, such as politics (Johnson & Goldwasser, 2018), social sciences (Forbes et al.,\n2020), social media (Hoover et al., 2020). Rather than simply using yes/no to classify a scene\nor paragraph into one of the ten moral foundations proposed by MFT, Social Chemistry\n101 (Forbes et al., 2020) and Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus (Hoover et al., 2020) use\na multi-dimensional metric to determine the categories. Social Chemistry 101 dissolves\nsocial norms into 12 dimensions, which contain moral foundations proposed in MFT. Moral\nStroies (Emelin et al., 2021) is a crowd-sourced dataset containing 12K short narratives\nfor goal-oriented moral reasoning grounded in social situations, genreated on social norms\nextracted from Social Chemistry 101 but ignoring controversial or value-neutral entries. Moral\nFoundations Dictionary (MFD) (Rezapour et al., 2019) is proposed on the foundation of\nMFT, and extended by Hopp et al. (2021) because MFD restricts the utility of certain words\nin expressing and understanding moral messages and natural variations of their meaning.\nIn evaluating LLMs, TrustGPT (Huang et al., 2023b) proposes a method to evaluate the\nethical and moral alignment of LLMs, which adopts two ways: active value alignment (AVA)\nand passive value alignment (PVA). The used dataset is Social Chemistry 101. The evaluation\nmetric for AVA is soft and hard accuracy due to the variations in human evaluation when\nconsidering the same object, while the metric for PVA is the proportion of cases where LLMs\nrefuse to answer. Results on TrustGPT show that on AVA, LLMs evaluated perform well\non soft accuracy compared to hard accuracy. It can also be concluded that LLMs evaluated\nhave certain judgment ability for social norms since the hard precision is above 0.5. However,\nthe performance on PVA is not good. ETHICS (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) is proposed based\non previous works which focus on various principles for narrow applications (Kitaev et al.,\n2020; Achiam & Amodei, 2019; Roller et al., 2021; Christiano et al., 2017) and reorganizes\nfive dimensions which are justice, deontology, virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and commonsense\nmoral judgements. 0/1-loss is used in the experiments of evaluating LLMs on ETHICS.\nEvaluation with Crowdsourced Ethics and Morality Ethics and Morality defined in\nthis way are all established by crowdsourced workers, who judge ethics and morality without\nprofessional guidance or training, only through their own preference. Botzer et al. (2021) focus\non analyzing moral judgements rendered on social media by capturing the moral judgements\nwhich are passed in the subreddit /r/AmITheAsshole on Reddit. The labels of the collected\ndata in their work are determined entirely by public voting in the social media community.\n22"

Soft accuracy takes into account the variations in human evaluation when considering the same object, while hard accuracy focuses on precise evaluation. The results show that LLMs perform well on soft accuracy compared to hard accuracy. This indicates that LLMs have a certain judgment ability for social norms, as the hard precision is above 0.5.\n\nFor PVA, TrustGPT measures the proportion of cases where LLMs refuse to answer. The performance of LLMs on PVA is not good, suggesting that they struggle with passive value alignment.\n\nOverall, TrustGPT's evaluation of LLMs shows that they have the ability to align with ethical and moral values to some extent, but there is room for improvement, particularly in passive value alignment.",

After noting the phenomena revealed by WinoBias and Winogender, GAP\n(Webster et al., 2018) creates a corpus of 8,908 manually annotated ambiguous pronoun\nexamples from Wikipedia, intending to promote equitable modeling of reference phenomena\nthrough detailed corpus annotation.

Therefore, they create a new\ndataset, the Gender Inclusive Coreference dataset (GICOREF), written and described by\ntransgender individuals, to test the performance of coreference resolution systems on texts\ndiscussing non-binary and binary transgender individuals. They observe significant room for\nimprovement in coreference systems, with the best-performing system achieving an F1 score\nof only 34%.\nHowever, a recent study (Blodgett et al., 2021) exposes several issues in the reliability of\nboth WinoBias and Winogender datasets. They identify a series of pitfalls in these datasets,\nincluding unstated assumptions, ambiguities, and inconsistencies. Their analysis show that\nonly 0%\u201358% of the tests in these benchmarks are unaffected by these pitfalls, suggesting\nthat these benchmarks might not provide effective measurements of stereotyping.\nMachine Translation Some studies have observed that online machine translation services\nlike Google Translate or Microsoft Translator exhibit certain gender biases (Alvarez-Melis &\nJaakkola, 2017; Font & Costa-juss\u00e0, 2019). For example, regardless of the context, \u2018nurse\u2019 is\ntranslated as female, and \u2018programmer\u2019 as male. Such biases can be harmful if they occur\nfrequently.\nThe WinoMT Challenge Set (Stanovsky et al., 2019) conducts the first large-scale, multilingual\nevaluation on translation systems. They combine Winogender and WinoBias to assess gender\nbias in MT. They design an automatic translation evaluation method for eight different\ntarget languages. MT models have to translate all sentences into the target language. They\nuse simple heuristic methods and morphological analysis specific to the target language to\nextract the gender of the target entities. They calculate the percentage of instances that\nmachine-generated translations have the correct gender as an indicator to evaluate four\nwidely used commercial MT systems and two state-of-the-art MT models. Their results\nshow significant gender bias in all tested languages. Further, Renduchintala & Williams\n(2021) expand this gender study in translation tasks to 20 languages. They believe that\noperationalizing gender bias measurement in an unambiguous task is clearer than framing\nit as an ambiguous task. So, they add contextual information to the occupational nouns\nto clearly specify the gender of the person referred to. For example, in the sentence \u201cMy\nnurse is a good father\u201d, the gender identity of the nurse is unambiguous. In such a context,\nthey determine whether the model\u2019s stereotypical tendencies lead to translation errors. They\nobserve that the accuracy does not exceed 70% for any languages or models. When the\ntrigger word gender and occupational gender does not match, the accuracy drops. These two\ndatasets can be easily extended to more languages and language models.\n25"

A model is\nconsidered to pass the WinoBias test only if it achieves high F1 scores in both tasks. Both\nstudies indicate that current systems overly rely on social stereotypes when parsing \u2018he\u2019 and\n\u2018she\u2019 pronouns. After noting the phenomena revealed by WinoBias and Winogender, GAP\n(Webster et al., 2018) creates a corpus of 8,908 manually annotated ambiguous pronoun\nexamples from Wikipedia, intending to promote equitable modeling of reference phenomena\nthrough detailed corpus annotation. Additionally, Cao & III (2020) propose that sociological\nand sociolinguistic gender concepts are not always binary, for example, some drag performers\nare referred to as \u2018she\u2019 during performances and \u2018he\u2019 otherwise. Therefore, they create a new\ndataset, the Gender Inclusive Coreference dataset (GICOREF), written and described by\ntransgender individuals, to test the performance of coreference resolution systems on texts\ndiscussing non-binary and binary transgender individuals. They observe significant room for\nimprovement in coreference systems, with the best-performing system achieving an F1 score\nof only 34%.\nHowever, a recent study (Blodgett et al., 2021) exposes several issues in the reliability of\nboth WinoBias and Winogender datasets. They identify a series of pitfalls in these datasets,\nincluding unstated assumptions, ambiguities, and inconsistencies. Their analysis show that\nonly 0%\u201358% of the tests in these benchmarks are unaffected by these pitfalls, suggesting\nthat these benchmarks might not provide effective measurements of stereotyping.\nMachine Translation Some studies have observed that online machine translation services\nlike Google Translate or Microsoft Translator exhibit certain gender biases (Alvarez-Melis &\nJaakkola, 2017; Font & Costa-juss\u00e0, 2019). For example, regardless of the context, \u2018nurse\u2019 is\ntranslated as female, and \u2018programmer\u2019 as male. Such biases can be harmful if they occur\nfrequently.\nThe WinoMT Challenge Set (Stanovsky et al., 2019) conducts the first large-scale, multilingual\nevaluation on translation systems. They combine Winogender and WinoBias to assess gender\nbias in MT. They design an automatic translation evaluation method for eight different\ntarget languages. MT models have to translate all sentences into the target language. They\nuse simple heuristic methods and morphological analysis specific to the target language to\nextract the gender of the target entities. They calculate the percentage of instances that\nmachine-generated translations have the correct gender as an indicator to evaluate four\nwidely used commercial MT systems and two state-of-the-art MT models. Their results\nshow significant gender bias in all tested languages. Further, Renduchintala & Williams\n(2021) expand this gender study in translation tasks to 20 languages. They believe that\noperationalizing gender bias measurement in an unambiguous task is clearer than framing\nit as an ambiguous task. So, they add contextual information to the occupational nouns\nto clearly specify the gender of the person referred to. For example, in the sentence \u201cMy\nnurse is a good father\u201d, the gender identity of the nurse is unambiguous. In such a context,\nthey determine whether the model\u2019s stereotypical tendencies lead to translation errors. They\nobserve that the accuracy does not exceed 70% for any languages or models. When the\ntrigger word gender and occupational gender does not match, the accuracy drops. These two\ndatasets can be easily extended to more languages and language models.\n25"

The inter-sentential test consists\nof context sentences about the target group, followed by free-form candidate sentences, also\ncapturing stereotypical, counter-stereotypical, or unrelated associations. SS has been used to\nevaluate pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa. CrowS-Pairs\n(CS) includes only intra-sentential prediction tests and covers nine biases, race, gender, sexual\norientation, religion, age, nationality, disability, appearance, and socio-economic status or\nprofession. It requires crowdsourced workers to write sentences about a disadvantaged group,\nwhich either exhibit a stereotype or counter the target group, and then pairs sentences\nminimal differences about a contrasting advantaged group. Unlike SS, CS disrupts groups\nrather than attributes. The evaluation metric used in CS has been adjusted accordingly,\nestimating the rate of unaltered tokens vs. altered tokens, not the other way round, to\navoid higher probabilities for words like \u2018John\u2019 just because of their frequency in the training\ndata, rather than learned social biases. Similarly, Hosseini et al. (2023) propose a modified\nTOXIGEN, selecting only sentences that all annotators agree biased towards the target group\nto reduce noise in the ToxiGen, and using log perplexity to assess the likelihood of benign\nand harmful sentences. The higher the log perplexity, the less likely the model will generate\nthose sentences. They measure the log perplexity of each sentence in the evaluation dataset\nand assess 24 PLMs, including GPT-2, which shows lower safety scores, indicating a higher\nlikelihood of generating harmful and biased content.\nBesides examining model preferences, a more direct way to measure bias is from the model\u2019s\ngenerated text. In this evaluation way, we provide a context to a model, which yields a\nresponse to the given context. We then evaluate the bias in the model\u2019s response. However,\nthe outputs of LLMs are usually very complex. Evaluating bias requires not only that the\nLLMs have a good understanding and compliance with the prompt or instruction, but also\nthat we have good metrics to assess the degree of bias in the generated outputs.\nSome works adopt automatic evaluation metrics. Liu et al. (2020a) use four indicators,\ndiversity, politeness, sentiment and attribute words, to evaluate the race and gender domains\nof the seq2seq generative model, which can also be applied to the evaluation of LLMs.\nMeanwhile, BOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) extends this to five types of biases: occupation,\ngender, race, religion, and political ideology. These sentences are collected from Wikipedia,\ntruncated, and provided to LLMs as the first half of a sentence, with the LLMs being tasked\nwith completing the second half.

                "unrelated associations, acquired from crowdsourced workers. The inter-sentential test consists\nof context sentences about the target group, followed by free-form candidate sentences, also\ncapturing stereotypical, counter-stereotypical, or unrelated associations. SS has been used to\nevaluate pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT, GPT-2, and RoBERTa. CrowS-Pairs\n(CS) includes only intra-sentential prediction tests and covers nine biases, race, gender, sexual\norientation, religion, age, nationality, disability, appearance, and socio-economic status or\nprofession. It requires crowdsourced workers to write sentences about a disadvantaged group,\nwhich either exhibit a stereotype or counter the target group, and then pairs sentences\nminimal differences about a contrasting advantaged group. Unlike SS, CS disrupts groups\nrather than attributes. The evaluation metric used in CS has been adjusted accordingly,\nestimating the rate of unaltered tokens vs. altered tokens, not the other way round, to\navoid higher probabilities for words like \u2018John\u2019 just because of their frequency in the training\ndata, rather than learned social biases. Similarly, Hosseini et al. (2023) propose a modified\nTOXIGEN, selecting only sentences that all annotators agree biased towards the target group\nto reduce noise in the ToxiGen, and using log perplexity to assess the likelihood of benign\nand harmful sentences. The higher the log perplexity, the less likely the model will generate\nthose sentences. They measure the log perplexity of each sentence in the evaluation dataset\nand assess 24 PLMs, including GPT-2, which shows lower safety scores, indicating a higher\nlikelihood of generating harmful and biased content.\nBesides examining model preferences, a more direct way to measure bias is from the model\u2019s\ngenerated text. In this evaluation way, we provide a context to a model, which yields a\nresponse to the given context. We then evaluate the bias in the model\u2019s response. However,\nthe outputs of LLMs are usually very complex. Evaluating bias requires not only that the\nLLMs have a good understanding and compliance with the prompt or instruction, but also\nthat we have good metrics to assess the degree of bias in the generated outputs.\nSome works adopt automatic evaluation metrics. Liu et al. (2020a) use four indicators,\ndiversity, politeness, sentiment and attribute words, to evaluate the race and gender domains\nof the seq2seq generative model, which can also be applied to the evaluation of LLMs.\nMeanwhile, BOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) extends this to five types of biases: occupation,\ngender, race, religion, and political ideology. These sentences are collected from Wikipedia,\ntruncated, and provided to LLMs as the first half of a sentence, with the LLMs being tasked\nwith completing the second half. BOLD then evaluates advanced LLMs from four aspects:\ngender polarity, regard (Sheng et al., 2019), sentiments and toxicity. Another study conducted\nby Sheng et al. (2021) expands the categories of biases to social classes, sexual orientations,\nraces and genders, and jointly assess the bias scores in model responses from four aspects:\noffensiveness, harmful agreements, occupational associations, and gendered coreferences.

                "4.4 Truthfulness\nLLMs have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating natural language text. The\nfluency and coherence of LLM-generated texts are even competitive with those of human-\nauthored discourses. This proficiency has opened up avenues for the application of LLMs\nacross a diverse spectrum of practical domains, including but not limited to education, finance,\nlaw, and medicine. However, despite their fluency and coherence, LLMs may fabricate facts\nand generate misinformation, thereby reducing the reliability of the generated texts (Bang\net al., 2023). This limitation hinders their usage in specialized and rigorous applications such\nas law and medicine and exacerbates the risk of the spread of misinformation. Consequently,\nit is crucial to verify the reliability of LLM-authored texts and conduct comprehensive\nassessments towards their truthfulness. This will ensure that the information generated by\nLLMs is accurate and reliable, thereby enhancing their utility in various practical domains.\n4.4.1 Datasets for Evaluating Truthfulness\nIn the pursuit of evaluating the truthfulness of LLMs, various datasets have been curated.\nThese datasets can be categorized into three primary types based on their associated tasks:\nquestion answering, dialogue, and summarization.\nQuestion Answering Question answering datasets play a critical role in assessing the\ntruthfulness of LLMs. The majority of these datasets serve as a means to evaluate the models\u2019\nproficiency in answering questions that remain unanswerable due to various factors, including\nthose outside the current scope of human knowledge or those lacking essential context and\nbackground information needed to arrive at a verifiable answer. When presented with such\nunanswerable questions, LLMs should indicate uncertainty in their responses rather than\nattempting to provide deterministic answers that lack factual grounding.

                "4.4 Truthfulness\nLLMs have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating natural language text. The\nfluency and coherence of LLM-generated texts are even competitive with those of human-\nauthored discourses. This proficiency has opened up avenues for the application of LLMs\nacross a diverse spectrum of practical domains, including but not limited to education, finance,\nlaw, and medicine. However, despite their fluency and coherence, LLMs may fabricate facts\nand generate misinformation, thereby reducing the reliability of the generated texts (Bang\net al., 2023). This limitation hinders their usage in specialized and rigorous applications such\nas law and medicine and exacerbates the risk of the spread of misinformation. Consequently,\nit is crucial to verify the reliability of LLM-authored texts and conduct comprehensive\nassessments towards their truthfulness. This will ensure that the information generated by\nLLMs is accurate and reliable, thereby enhancing their utility in various practical domains.\n4.4.1 Datasets for Evaluating Truthfulness\nIn the pursuit of evaluating the truthfulness of LLMs, various datasets have been curated.\nThese datasets can be categorized into three primary types based on their associated tasks:\nquestion answering, dialogue, and summarization.\nQuestion Answering Question answering datasets play a critical role in assessing the\ntruthfulness of LLMs. The majority of these datasets serve as a means to evaluate the models\u2019\nproficiency in answering questions that remain unanswerable due to various factors, including\nthose outside the current scope of human knowledge or those lacking essential context and\nbackground information needed to arrive at a verifiable answer. When presented with such\nunanswerable questions, LLMs should indicate uncertainty in their responses rather than\nattempting to provide deterministic answers that lack factual grounding. We provide a brief\noverview of key question answering datasets that encompass such unanswerable questions,\nthereby affording an effective means to assess the performance of LLMs with respect to\ntruthfulness.\n\u2022NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017) is a machine comprehension dataset comprising\n119,633 human-authored question-answer pairs based on CNN news articles.

These approaches can be broadly categorized into three groups: natural language\ninference (NLI) based methods, question answering (QA) and generation (QG) based methods,\nand methods utilizing LLMs.\nNLI-based Methods NLI is a fundamental task in natural language processing. It is\nprimarilyfocusedondiscerningthelogicalrelationshipbetweentwopiecesoftext, traditionally\nreferred to as the \u201cpremise\u201d and the \u201chypothesis\u201d. The NLI task requires classifying the\nrelationship between the premise and hypothesis as one of three potential logical relations:\nentailment, contradiction, or neutral. NLI plays a pivotal role in ensuring the consistency for\ntext generated by applications such as dialogue and summarization systems. For dialogue\nsystems, it is essential that the produced utterances are attributable to relevant source\ninformation, including the dialogue context and external knowledge (Welleck et al., 2019;\nDziri et al., 2021; Lotfi et al., 2022). Similarly, for summarization systems, it is crucial that\nthe generated summaries maintain consistency with the source document. The process of\nverifying the consistency between system outputs and source texts can be framed as an NLI\nproblem (Falke et al., 2019; Laban et al., 2022; Maynez et al., 2020; Aharoni et al., 2022;\nKryscinski et al., 2020; Utama et al., 2022; Roit et al., 2023), where an entailment result\nindicates that the source text and system output are consistent. The entailment models used\nfor consistency verification are usually fine-tuned from pretrained language models like BERT\n(Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and mT5 (Xue\net al., 2021) on NLI datasets such as SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015), MNLI (Williams et al.,\n2018), and ANLI (Nie et al., 2020).\nQAQG-based Methods The Question Answering and Question Generation (QAQG)-\nbased method is a novel approach for evaluating factual consistency between two texts.\nOriginally proposed for summarization tasks (Durmus et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Scialom\n34"

In contrast to the\nabove mentioned benchmarks which are annotated at the span, sentence or summary level,\nCao et al. (2022) construct a benchmark annotated at the entity level, while Cao & Wang\n(2021) introduce the CLIFF benchmark with word-level annotations. These provides more\nfine-grained annotations compared to prior work. To enable more robust and standardized\nevaluation of factuality on modern summarization systems, Tang et al. (2023a) construct\nthe AGGREFACT benchmark. AGGREFACT aggregates 9 existing factuality-annotated\ndatasets, including FactCC (Kryscinski et al., 2020), Wang\u201920 (Wang et al., 2020), SummEval\n(Fabbri et al., 2021), Polytope (Huang et al., 2020), Cao\u201922 (Cao et al., 2022), XSumFaith\n(Maynez et al., 2020), FRANK (Pagnoni et al., 2021), Goyal\u201921 (Goyal & Durrett, 2021),\nand CLIFF (Cao & Wang, 2021). By unifying multiple datasets and stratifying summaries\nbased on underlying models, AGGREFACT allows for more rigorous analysis of performance,\nespecially on recent state-of-the-art models.\n4.4.2 Methods for Evaluating Truthfulness\nIn addition to benchmark datasets for evaluating the factual correctness of language models,\nthe methodology itself for assessing truthfulness is another crucial driver of progress in this\nfield. These approaches can be broadly categorized into three groups: natural language\ninference (NLI) based methods, question answering (QA) and generation (QG) based methods,\nand methods utilizing LLMs.\nNLI-based Methods NLI is a fundamental task in natural language processing. It is\nprimarilyfocusedondiscerningthelogicalrelationshipbetweentwopiecesoftext, traditionally\nreferred to as the \u201cpremise\u201d and the \u201chypothesis\u201d. The NLI task requires classifying the\nrelationship between the premise and hypothesis as one of three potential logical relations:\nentailment, contradiction, or neutral. NLI plays a pivotal role in ensuring the consistency for\ntext generated by applications such as dialogue and summarization systems. For dialogue\nsystems, it is essential that the produced utterances are attributable to relevant source\ninformation, including the dialogue context and external knowledge (Welleck et al., 2019;\nDziri et al., 2021; Lotfi et al., 2022). Similarly, for summarization systems, it is crucial that\nthe generated summaries maintain consistency with the source document. The process of\nverifying the consistency between system outputs and source texts can be framed as an NLI\nproblem (Falke et al., 2019; Laban et al., 2022; Maynez et al., 2020; Aharoni et al., 2022;\nKryscinski et al., 2020; Utama et al., 2022; Roit et al., 2023), where an entailment result\nindicates that the source text and system output are consistent. The entailment models used\nfor consistency verification are usually fine-tuned from pretrained language models like BERT\n(Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), and mT5 (Xue\net al., 2021) on NLI datasets such as SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015), MNLI (Williams et al.,\n2018), and ANLI (Nie et al., 2020).\nQAQG-based Methods The Question Answering and Question Generation (QAQG)-\nbased method is a novel approach for evaluating factual consistency between two texts.\nOriginally proposed for summarization tasks (Durmus et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Scialom\n34"

Specifically, the QAQG pipeline first employs a QG model to automatically\ngenerate questions or question-answer pairs from the summary text. If only questions are\ngenerated in the initial QG step, these questions are subsequently answered by a QA model\nconditioned separately on the summary and source document (Wang et al., 2020). However,\nif question-answer pairs are produced during QG, the questions are only answered by a QA\nmodel conditioned on the source document (Durmus et al., 2020). Subsequently, the similarity\nbetween the two sets of answers is quantified, typically using token-based matching metrics\nsuch as F1 scores, as an indicator of consistency between the summary and source document.\nThe underlying intuition is that since the summary contains a subset of the information in\nthe source document, the answers conditioned on the summary and document should exhibit\nhigh similarity if the summary faithfully represents the document. This QAQG framework\ncan be analogously applied to dialogue tasks, where questions are generated conditioned on\nthe dialogue responses and then answered by a QA model conditioned on the given knowledge\nsource (Honovich et al., 2021; Dziri et al., 2022a; Deng et al., 2023b).\nLLM-based Methods Recent studies suggest that when provided with appropriate\nprompts, LLMs can serve as general-purpose evaluators of text quality (Fu et al., 2023;\nWang et al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023h; Li et al., 2023d; Chen et al., 2023d;\nZheng et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023), as well as evaluators for task-specific\napplications such as translation (Kocmi & Federmann, 2023) and summarization (Chen\net al., 2023b; Gekhman et al., 2023). In the context of LLMs\u2019 truthfulness, Tam et al. (2023)\npropose measuring the factual consistency of LLMs by prompting them to evaluate how\noften they prefer factually consistent summaries over inconsistent ones for a given source\ndocument. Their research uses LLMs performance on this factual consistency assessment\ntask in summarization as an indicator of the models\u2019 factual consistency. Likewise, Chern\net al. (2023) and Min et al. (2023) introduce FacTool and FActScore, respectively, to assess\nthe factuality of text generated by LLMs. Specifically, FacTool (Chern et al., 2023) first\nprompts LLMs to extract claims from the text to be evaluated, based on natural language\ndefinitions of claims for different tasks. Subsequently, FacTool (Chern et al., 2023) prompts\nLLMs to generate queries from these extracted claims, enabling them to query external tools\nsuch as search engines, code interpreters, or LLMs themselves for evidence collection. Finally,\nFacTool (Chern et al., 2023) prompts LLMs to compare the claims against the evidence and\nassign binary factuality labels to each claim. In a manner similar to FacTool (Chern et al.,\n2023), FActScore (Min et al., 2023) assesses text factuality by first decomposing the text\ninto short statements using LLMs. Each of these short statements represents an atomic fact,\ncontaining a single piece of information.

(2023a) propose PromptBench, a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of\nLLMs by attacking them with adversarial prompts (dynamically created character-, word-,\nsentence-, and semantic-level prompts). The adversarial prompts are used to evaluate eight\ndifferent NLP tasks, each of which has its own dataset for evaluation. Liu et al. (2023i)\nevaluate the robustness of LLMs in handling prompt typos using prompts from the Justice\ndataset. Initially, LLMs are prompted to generate typos based on the Justice dataset. Then\nthese generated prompts with typos are used to prompt LLMs to investigate the impact of\nprompt typos on the outputs of LLMs.\n5.1.2 Task Robustness\nWang et al. (2023b) evaluate the robustness of ChatGPT across various NLP tasks, including\ntranslation, question-answering (QA), text classification, and natural language inference\n(NLI). They perform this evaluation using AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) and ANLI (Nie\n37"

(2023) conduct a robustness evaluation of ChatGPT for the translation task using\nthe WMT datasets (WMT19 Biomedical Translation Task (Bawden et al., 2019), set2 and\nset3 of WMT20 Robustness Task(Specia et al., 2020)). These datasets consist of parallel\ncorpora containing naturally occurring noises and domain-specific terminology words. For\nthe question-answering task, Kokaia et al. (2023) mainly focus on improving the robustness\nof LLM from closed book into open book QA. To evaluate the improvement in robustness,\nthey utilize a dataset consisting of 1,475 open-ended general knowledge questions, which\nare intentionally perturbed with typos and grammatical errors. Zhao et al. (2023) also\nevaluate the robustness of LLMs in the question-answering task, specifically in table-based\nquestion-answering. To achieve this, they create a new dataset named RobuT, comprising\n143,477 pairs of examples sourced from the WTQ (Pasupat & Liang, 2015), WikiSQL (Zhong\net al., 2017), and SQA (Iyyer et al., 2017) datasets. The RobuT dataset includes data\nwith table headers, table content, natural language questions (NLQ), and various types of\nperturbations. The main types of perturbations are character- and word-level perturbations,\nalong with row or column swapping, masking, and extension. Ko et al. (2023) primarily focus\non evaluting text classification task. They propose SynTextBench, a framework designed for\ngenerating synthetic datasets to evaluate the robustness and accuracy of LLMs in sentence\nclassification tasks. Gan & Mori (2023) also focus on evaluating classification tasks using\nJapanese language datasets: MARC-ja, JNLI, and JSTS. These are distinct datasets from\nJGLUE benchamrk (Kurihara et al., 2022). The prompt templates are divided into five types:\ninstruction prompt, base prompt, Japanese honorific removal prompt, changed punctuation\nprompt, and changed sentence pattern prompt.\nSince the emergence of large language models, the range of solvable tasks has been expanding\nto include tasks like code generation, mathematical reasoning, and dialogue generation. It\nis essential to evaluate the robustness of LLMs for solving these tasks. Wang et al. (2023d)\npropose ReCode, a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in code generation.\nUsing HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) datasets, ReCode\ngenerates perturbations in code docstring, function, syntax, and format. These perturbation\nstyles encompass character- and word-level insertions or transformations. Shirafuji et al.\n(2023) conduct an evaluation of the robustness of LLMs in solving programming problems.\nThe dataset is compiled from Aizu Online Judge (AOJ) and consists of 40 programming\nproblems. It is then modified by randomizing variable names, anonymizing output settings,\nrephrasing synonyms, and inverse problem specifications. For the math reasoning task, Stolfo\net al. (2023) introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of LLMs. They\nutilize datasets including ASDiv-A (Miao et al., 2020), MAWPS (Koncel-Kedziorski et al.,\n2016), and SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021) for this evaluation. The evaluation is grounded\nin causal inference factors, including textual framing, numerical operands, and operation\ntypes. Li et al. (2023f) propose DGSlow, a benchmark for evaluating robustness of dialogue\ngeneration task using white-box attack. DGSlow generates adversarial examples with existing\nbenchmark datasets, e.g. BlendedSkillTalk (Smith et al., 2020), Persona-Chat (Zhang et al.,\n2018), ConvAI2 (Dinan et al., 2019a), and EmpatheticDialogues (Rashkin et al., 2019).\nThe evaluation of robustness towards multilinguality is also crucial.

In contrast, M3Exam (Zhang et al., 2023b) broadens\nthe scope of evaluation to nine languages, encompassing both Latin and non-Latin languages,\nas well as high-resource and low-resource languages.\nExcept for AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023), which incorporates fill-in-the-blank questions, all\nthe aforementioned benchmarks primarily rely on multiple-choice questions as their main\nevaluation format, with accuracy serving as the key performance metric. Consequently,\nthese benchmarks tend to overlook the inclusion of open-ended questions. In contrast,\nLucyEval (Zeng et al., 2023b) pioneers a more diverse evaluation approach by introducing\nthree categories of subjective questions: conceptual explanations, short answer questions,\nand computational questions. Additionally, LucyEval (Zeng et al., 2023b) introduces a\nnovel evaluation metric known as GScore. For the assessment of short answer questions\nand conceptual explanations, GScore aggregates a variety of metrics, including BLEU-4,\nROUGE-2, ChrF, and Semantic Similarity, through a weighted combination. This holistic\napproach offers a relatively comprehensive yet straightforward means of evaluating subjective\nproficiency.\nThe details of the benchmarks mentioned above can be found in Table 5.\n7.2.2 Evaluation Results\nNext, we will discuss the evaluation results on the aforementioned benchmarks in terms of\nthe subject competence of LLMs, the size of LLMs, and the evaluation setting.\nSubject Competence Regarding average accuracy, GPT-4 consistently demonstrates top-\ntier performance across all benchmarks on which it has been evaluated (Zhong et al., 2023,\nHuang et al., 2023c, Liu et al., 2023a, Zeng et al., 2023b). However, it\u2019s important to note\nthat the models exhibit an uneven performance distribution across different subjects, with\neach model displaying strengths in specific domains (Hendrycks et al., 2021b, Li et al., 2023a).\nFor example, when compared to text-davinci-003, ChatGPT excels notably in tasks related\nto geography, biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, where substantial external\nknowledge is required, while its performance remains comparable to text-davinci-003 in\n50"

Encouragingly, advanced LLMs\nhave been actively reinforcing their performance in areas where they initially face challenges.\nFor instance, in MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), GPT-3 performs suboptimally in subjects\ntied to human values such as law and morality. However, in CMMLU and AGIEval (Li et al.,\n2023a, Zhong et al., 2023), GPT-4 showcases substantial improvement in tasks related to law\nand morality, even surpassing the average human performance level.

                "datasets to be leaked and become training data for LLMs. Evaluation data contamination\ndetection is time-consuming as LLMs are usually trained on a huge amount of data. Dynamic\nevaluation could keep updating evaluation data in a quick way so that LLMs could not\nhave opportunities to use them as training data. Second, most current benchmarks use\nquestion-answering tasks in a multi-choice style. An important consideration for this is\nthat clear answers are annotated for these questions, which facilitates automatic evaluation\nthrough accuracy. However, this excludes open-ended questions, which may provide insights\ninto LLMs not seen in choice-based evaluation. Crowdsourced workers or advanced LLMs such\nas GPT-4 are usually used to evaluate LLMs on open-ended questions. Although advanced\nLLMs are more cost-efficient than humans, they could make mistakes about facts and take\nbiases with their own preferences. In dynamic evaluation, a promising alternative may be\nto evaluate LLMs via debate among multiple advanced LLMs. Third, static benchmarks\nassess LLMs on static factual knowledge. However, knowledge and information (e.g., the\npresident of a country) could change over time in the real world. A reliable LLM should\nhave the capability to update its knowledge to adapt to a changing world. This suggests that\ndynamic evaluation should evaluate LLMs with test data that align with factuality and the\nchanging world. Finally, as LLMs continue to evolve, static benchmarks would be quickly\nbecome outdated when LLMs approach to the human-level performance, suggesting that\ndynamically and continuously evolving benchmarks in terms of difficulty are desirable.\n8.4 Enhancement-Oriented Evaluation for LLMs\nThe predominant evaluation methods and benchmarks for LLMs have focused primarily on\nproviding quantitative performance measures on specific tasks or multiple dimensions (Zhong\net al., 2022; Jain et al., 2023). While the reported scores enable model comparison, the\nevaluations offer limited insights into LLMs. There is a need for techniques that thoroughly\nanalyze evaluation results to reveal weaknesses, followed by directly exploring improvements\nto address the identified shortcomings. Furthermore, although developing models that satisfy\nthe criteria of helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty remains an important goal (Askell et al.,\n2021), comprehensive benchmarks and methods that jointly assess models across these critical\ndimensions for alignment with human values and provide actionable insights for further model\nimprovements are still lacking.

                "datasets to be leaked and become training data for LLMs. Evaluation data contamination\ndetection is time-consuming as LLMs are usually trained on a huge amount of data. Dynamic\nevaluation could keep updating evaluation data in a quick way so that LLMs could not\nhave opportunities to use them as training data. Second, most current benchmarks use\nquestion-answering tasks in a multi-choice style. An important consideration for this is\nthat clear answers are annotated for these questions, which facilitates automatic evaluation\nthrough accuracy. However, this excludes open-ended questions, which may provide insights\ninto LLMs not seen in choice-based evaluation. Crowdsourced workers or advanced LLMs such\nas GPT-4 are usually used to evaluate LLMs on open-ended questions. Although advanced\nLLMs are more cost-efficient than humans, they could make mistakes about facts and take\nbiases with their own preferences. In dynamic evaluation, a promising alternative may be\nto evaluate LLMs via debate among multiple advanced LLMs. Third, static benchmarks\nassess LLMs on static factual knowledge. However, knowledge and information (e.g., the\npresident of a country) could change over time in the real world. A reliable LLM should\nhave the capability to update its knowledge to adapt to a changing world. This suggests that\ndynamic evaluation should evaluate LLMs with test data that align with factuality and the\nchanging world. Finally, as LLMs continue to evolve, static benchmarks would be quickly\nbecome outdated when LLMs approach to the human-level performance, suggesting that\ndynamically and continuously evolving benchmarks in terms of difficulty are desirable.\n8.4 Enhancement-Oriented Evaluation for LLMs\nThe predominant evaluation methods and benchmarks for LLMs have focused primarily on\nproviding quantitative performance measures on specific tasks or multiple dimensions (Zhong\net al., 2022; Jain et al., 2023). While the reported scores enable model comparison, the\nevaluations offer limited insights into LLMs. There is a need for techniques that thoroughly\nanalyze evaluation results to reveal weaknesses, followed by directly exploring improvements\nto address the identified shortcomings. Furthermore, although developing models that satisfy\nthe criteria of helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty remains an important goal (Askell et al.,\n2021), comprehensive benchmarks and methods that jointly assess models across these critical\ndimensions for alignment with human values and provide actionable insights for further model\nimprovements are still lacking. In summary, advancing evaluation paradigms will require an\nenhancement-oriented approach that not only benchmarks performance but also provides a\nconstructive analysis of model weaknesses and clear directions for improvement.\n9 Conclusion\nThe development pace of LLMs has been astonishing, showcasing remarkable progress\nacross numerous tasks.

            "reference_answer": "The limitations of current benchmarks in evaluating LLMs include the following:\n\n1. Evaluation data contamination: LLMs are usually trained on a large amount of data, and it is time-consuming to detect if the evaluation data has been leaked and used as training data. Dynamic evaluation can address this limitation by continuously updating the evaluation data, preventing LLMs from using it for training.\n\n2. Exclusion of open-ended questions: Most current benchmarks use question-answering tasks in a multi-choice style, which requires clear answers for automatic evaluation. However, this excludes open-ended questions that may provide valuable insights into LLMs. Enhancement-oriented evaluation can involve crowdsourced workers or advanced LLMs to evaluate LLMs on open-ended questions.\n\n3. Static assessment of factual knowledge: Static benchmarks assess LLMs based on static factual knowledge, but real-world knowledge and information can change over time. A reliable LLM should have the ability to update its knowledge to adapt to a changing world. Dynamic evaluation can address this limitation by evaluating LLMs with test data that align with factuality and the changing world.\n\n4. Outdated benchmarks: As LLMs continue to evolve, static benchmarks quickly become outdated when LLMs approach human-level performance. Enhancement-oriented evaluation suggests the need for dynamically and continuously evolving benchmarks in terms of difficulty.\n\nTo address these limitations, an enhancement-oriented evaluation approach is proposed. This approach goes beyond providing quantitative performance measures and focuses on thoroughly analyzing evaluation results to identify weaknesses in LLMs. It also provides clear directions for improvement, allowing for actionable insights to enhance LLMs. Additionally, there is a need for comprehensive benchmarks and methods that assess LLMs across critical dimensions such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty, aligning with human values.",

It examines 200 sentiment analysis systems and explores the potential biases that may exist in these systems based on gender and race. This research is important for understanding the limitations and potential biases of sentiment analysis technology, which is widely used in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and opinion mining. By identifying and addressing bias in sentiment analysis systems, this paper contributes to the development of more fair and unbiased computational linguistic models and applications.",
