SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Three Mile Island Nuclear Station (TMINS) is approximately 16 
kilometers (10 miles) southeast of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The TMINS 
site includes Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 1 and TMI-2. It 
encompasses approximately 178 hectares (440 acres), including the 
adjacent islands on the north end, a strip of land on the mainland 
along the eastern shore of the river, and an area on the eastern shore 
of Shelley Island. The TMINS site has significance in U.S. history 
because it is the site of the nation's most serious commercial nuclear 
power plant accident, occurring at TMI-2. On March 28, 1979, TMI-2 
experienced an accident initiated by interruption of secondary 
feedwater flow which led to a core heat up that caused fuel damage. The 
partial meltdown of the reactor core led to a very small offsite 
release of radioactivity. In response to this accident many changes 
occurred at nuclear power plants including emergency response planning, 
reactor operator training, human factors engineering, radiation 
protection and heightened NRC regulatory oversight.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated February 22, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23058A064), TMI-2Solutions requested an amendment to POL No. DPR-73. 
TMI-2Solutions will be engaging in certain major decommissioning 
activities, including the physical demolition of buildings previously 
deemed eligible for the NRHP. Because the impacts on the historic 
properties from these decommissioning activities have not been 
previously evaluated and are not bounded by the impact's discussion in 
NUREG-0586, ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement on 
Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities,'' TMI-2Solutions requested an 
amendment that would require evaluation of the impacts of the 
decommissioning activities on the NRHP-eligible properties, in 
compliance with paragraph 50.82(a)(6)(ii) of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR).
    Pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8, the NRC used its National Environmental 
Policy Act process for developing the EA to facilitate consultation 
pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act 
(NHPA).
    Adverse effects to historic properties would result from 
decommissioning activities at TMI-2. Therefore, the NRC and consulting 
parties proceeded with development of a programmatic agreement (PA) to 
resolve adverse effects. The draft PA was issued for public comment 
through a Federal Register notice dated March 6, 2024 (89 FR 16037). 
One comment was received and considered before finalizing the PA. The 
PA addresses the potential direct and indirect adverse effects from the 
decommissioning activities and ensures that appropriate mitigation 
measures are implemented. The NRC's EA references the final PA and, 
therefore, conclude NHPA section 106 consultation.
    In accordance with NRC's regulations in 10 CFR part 51, 
``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions,'' that implement the National Environment 
Protection Agency (NEPA), the NRC staff has prepared an EA documenting 
its environmental review of the license amendment application. Based on 
the environmental review, the NRC has made a determination that the 
proposed action will not significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment and that a FONSI is therefore appropriate.

III. Summary of Environmental Assessment

    The EA is publicly available in ADAMS under Accession No. 
ML24197A005. A summary description of the proposed action and expected 
environmental impacts is provided as follows.

[[Page 64965]]

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action is to amend POL No. DPR-73 so that TMI-
2Solutions can continue with certain major decommissioning activities 
planned under Phase 2 of its decommissioning schedule. Phase 2 
decommissioning activities include the removal of any radioactive 
components in preparation for demolition of structures, decommissioning 
and dismantlement of the TMI-2 site to a level that permits the release 
of the site, except for an area potentially to be set aside for storage 
of fuel-bearing material (small quantities of spent nuclear fuel, 
damaged core material, and high-level waste) on the independent spent 
fuel storage installation, backfilling of the site, license termination 
plan submittal and implementation, and site restoration activities. In 
order to comply with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(6)(ii), TMI-2Solutions requested 
that NRC evaluate the impacts of certain major decommissioning 
activities on historic and cultural resources and NRHP-eligible 
properties. The definition of major decommissioning activity is in 10 
CFR 50.2, which states ``major decommissioning activity means, for a 
nuclear power reactor facility, any activity that results in permanent 
removal of major radioactive components, permanently modifies the 
structure of the containment, or results in dismantling components for 
shipment containing greater than class C waste in accordance with Sec.  
61.55 of this chapter.'' Due to radioactive contamination, the TMI-2 
structures must be demolished and removed during decommissioning.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    In the EA, the staff assessed the potential environmental impacts 
from the proposed license amendment to the following resource areas: 
land use; visual and scenic resources; the geologic environment; 
surface and groundwater resources; ecological resources; air quality; 
noise; historic and cultural resources; socioeconomic conditions; 
environmental justice; public and occupational health; transportation; 
and waste generation and management. The NRC staff also considered the 
cumulative impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
actions when combined with the proposed action. The TMI-2 Historic 
District would be adversely affected by the TMI-2 decommissioning, and 
adverse effects cannot be avoided. The mitigation of adverse effects to 
the TMI-2 Historic District will be completed in accordance with the 
TMI-2 Demolition and Decommissioning Programmatic Agreement (NRC 
2024a).
    As part of the NRC's consultation under section 7 of the Endangered 
Species Act, NRC staff determined that the proposed action may affect 
but is not likely to adversely affect the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), 
northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), tricolored bat 
(Perimyotis subflavus), monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), 
northeastern bulrush (Scirpus ancistrochaetus), or green floater 
(Lasmigona subviridis). The NRC staff transmitted a letter to the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for its review and concurrence on May 
24, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24120A324). The FWS concurred with the 
NRC's findings on July 15, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24199A062).
    All other potential impacts from the proposed action were 
determined to be not significant, as described in the EA. The NRC staff 
found that there would be no significant negative cumulative impact to 
any resource area from the proposed action when added to other past, 
present, and reasonably foreseeable actions.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternative to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC staff considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Under the no-action alternative, the NRC would deny the licensee's 
request to allow for the continuation of major decommissioning 
activities under Phase 2. In this case, the NRC staff would not review 
the historic and cultural resource impacts of the major decommissioning 
activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.2 and would therefore disallow the 
removal of NRHP-eligible structures and any impacts to historic and 
cultural resources. However, due to the presence of radioactive 
contamination, TMI-2 structures, including the NRHP-eligible 
structures, must be removed during the decommissioning process. 
Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that denying the amendment request 
is not a reasonable alternative.

IV. Finding of No Significant Impact

    In accordance with the NEPA and 10 CFR part 51, the NRC staff has 
conducted an environmental review of a request for an amendment to POL 
No. DPR-73. The proposed amendment would revise the POL to allow the 
licensee to conduct decommissioning at TMI-2 covering activities that 
were not previously addressed in the staff's environmental assessments 
(site-specific historical and cultural resources). Based on its 
environmental review of the proposed action, the NRC staff has made a 
finding of no significant impact in the EA. Therefore, the NRC staff 
has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, that preparation of an 
environmental impact statement is not required for the proposed action 
and a FONSI is appropriate.

    Dated: August 2, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Three Mile Island Nuclear Station (TMINS) is approximately 16 
kilometers (10 miles) southeast of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The TMINS 
site includes Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 1 and TMI-2. It 
encompasses approximately 178 hectares (440 acres), including the 
adjacent islands on the north end, a strip of land on the mainland 
along the eastern shore of the river, and an area on the eastern shore 
of Shelley Island. The TMINS site has significance in U.S. history 
because it is the site of the nation's most serious commercial nuclear 
power plant accident, occurring at TMI-2. On March 28, 1979, TMI-2 
experienced an accident initiated by interruption of secondary 
feedwater flow which led to a core heat up that caused fuel damage. The 
partial meltdown of the reactor core led to a very small offsite 
release of radioactivity. In response to this accident many changes 
occurred at nuclear power plants including emergency response planning, 
reactor operator training, human factors engineering, radiation 
protection and heightened NRC regulatory oversight.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated February 22, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23058A064), TMI-2Solutions requested an amendment to POL No. DPR-73. 
TMI-2Solutions will be engaging in certain major decommissioning 
activities, including the physical demolition of buildings previously 
deemed eligible for the NRHP. Because the impacts on the historic 
properties from these decommissioning activities have not been 
previously evaluated and are not bounded by the impact's discussion in 
NUREG-0586, ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement on 
Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities,'' TMI-2Solutions requested an 
amendment that would require evaluation of the impacts of the 
decommissioning activities on the NRHP-eligible properties, in 
compliance with paragraph 50.82(a)(6)(ii) of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR).
    Pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8, the NRC used its National Environmental 
Policy Act process for developing the EA to facilitate consultation 
pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act 
(NHPA).
    Adverse effects to historic properties would result from 
decommissioning activities at TMI-2. Therefore, the NRC and consulting 
parties proceeded with development of a programmatic agreement (PA) to 
resolve adverse effects. The draft PA was issued for public comment 
through a Federal Register notice dated March 6, 2024 (89 FR 16037). 
One comment was received and considered before finalizing the PA. The 
PA addresses the potential direct and indirect adverse effects from the 
decommissioning activities and ensures that appropriate mitigation 
measures are implemented. The NRC's EA references the final PA and, 
therefore, conclude NHPA section 106 consultation.
    In accordance with NRC's regulations in 10 CFR part 51, 
``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions,'' that implement the National Environment 
Protection Agency (NEPA), the NRC staff has prepared an EA documenting 
its environmental review of the license amendment application. Based on 
the environmental review, the NRC has made a determination that the 
proposed action will not significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment and that a FONSI is therefore appropriate.

III. Summary of Environmental Assessment

    The EA is publicly available in ADAMS under Accession No. 
ML24197A005. A summary description of the proposed action and expected 
environmental impacts is provided as follows.

[[Page 64965]]

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action is to amend POL No. DPR-73 so that TMI-
2Solutions can continue with certain major decommissioning activities 
planned under Phase 2 of its decommissioning schedule. Phase 2 
decommissioning activities include the removal of any radioactive 
components in preparation for demolition of structures, decommissioning 
and dismantlement of the TMI-2 site to a level that permits the release 
of the site, except for an area potentially to be set aside for storage 
of fuel-bearing material (small quantities of spent nuclear fuel, 
damaged core material, and high-level waste) on the independent spent 
fuel storage installation, backfilling of the site, license termination 
plan submittal and implementation, and site restoration activities. In 
order to comply with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(6)(ii), TMI-2Solutions requested 
that NRC evaluate the impacts of certain major decommissioning 
activities on historic and cultural resources and NRHP-eligible 
properties. The definition of major decommissioning activity is in 10 
CFR 50.2, which states ``major decommissioning activity means, for a 
nuclear power reactor facility, any activity that results in permanent 
removal of major radioactive components, permanently modifies the 
structure of the containment, or results in dismantling components for 
shipment containing greater than class C waste in accordance with Sec.  
61.55 of this chapter.'' Due to radioactive contamination, the TMI-2 
structures must be demolished and removed during decommissioning.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    In the EA, the staff assessed the potential environmental impacts 
from the proposed license amendment to the following resource areas: 
land use; visual and scenic resources; the geologic environment; 
surface and groundwater resources; ecological resources; air quality; 
noise; historic and cultural resources; socioeconomic conditions; 
environmental justice; public and occupational health; transportation; 
and waste generation and management. The NRC staff also considered the 
cumulative impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
actions when combined with the proposed action. The TMI-2 Historic 
District would be adversely affected by the TMI-2 decommissioning, and 
adverse effects cannot be avoided. The mitigation of adverse effects to 
the TMI-2 Historic District will be completed in accordance with the 
TMI-2 Demolition and Decommissioning Programmatic Agreement (NRC 
2024a).
    As part of the NRC's consultation under section 7 of the Endangered 
Species Act, NRC staff determined that the proposed action may affect 
but is not likely to adversely affect the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), 
northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), tricolored bat 
(Perimyotis subflavus), monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), 
northeastern bulrush (Scirpus ancistrochaetus), or green floater 
(Lasmigona subviridis). The NRC staff transmitted a letter to the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for its review and concurrence on May 
24, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24120A324). The FWS concurred with the 
NRC's findings on July 15, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24199A062).
    All other potential impacts from the proposed action were 
determined to be not significant, as described in the EA. The NRC staff 
found that there would be no significant negative cumulative impact to 
any resource area from the proposed action when added to other past, 
present, and reasonably foreseeable actions.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternative to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC staff considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Under the no-action alternative, the NRC would deny the licensee's 
request to allow for the continuation of major decommissioning 
activities under Phase 2. In this case, the NRC staff would not review 
the historic and cultural resource impacts of the major decommissioning 
activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.2 and would therefore disallow the 
removal of NRHP-eligible structures and any impacts to historic and 
cultural resources. However, due to the presence of radioactive 
contamination, TMI-2 structures, including the NRHP-eligible 
structures, must be removed during the decommissioning process. 
Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that denying the amendment request 
is not a reasonable alternative.

IV. Finding of No Significant Impact

    In accordance with the NEPA and 10 CFR part 51, the NRC staff has 
conducted an environmental review of a request for an amendment to POL 
No. DPR-73. The proposed amendment would revise the POL to allow the 
licensee to conduct decommissioning at TMI-2 covering activities that 
were not previously addressed in the staff's environmental assessments 
(site-specific historical and cultural resources). Based on its 
environmental review of the proposed action, the NRC staff has made a 
finding of no significant impact in the EA. Therefore, the NRC staff 
has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, that preparation of an 
environmental impact statement is not required for the proposed action 
and a FONSI is appropriate.

II. Introduction

A. Background

    PNP consists of a single pressurized-water reactor located in 
Covert Township, Michigan, along the shoreline of Lake Michigan. 
Originally licensed for operation on March 24, 1971, the NRC issued a 
renewed operating license for PNP on January 17, 2007, with the renewed 
operating license term expiring on March 24, 2031.
    On June 13, 2022, Entergy Operations, Inc., the licensee who 
operated the facility prior to transfer of control of the PNP license 
to HDI and Holtec Palisades, LLC, submitted certifications that it had 
permanently ceased operations of PNP and permanently removed fuel from 
the reactor vessel in accordance with paragraph 50.82(a)(1) of title 10 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). When the NRC docketed the 
certifications, the PNP RFOL No. DPR-20 no longer authorized operation 
of the reactor, or emplacement or retention of fuel into the reactor 
vessel, as provided by 10 CFR 50.82(a)(2).
    HDI is seeking to return PNP to power operations and has submitted 
several requests for NRC approval to support allowing the resumption of 
power operations through March 24, 2031, the end of the renewed 
facility operating license term under PNP RFOL No. DPR-20. These 
requests include the license transfer application, which is the subject 
of this notice, and four license amendment requests. The hearing 
opportunity for the four license amendment requests is being addressed 
by a separate notice published in today's issue of the Federal 
Register.

B. Transfer Request

    The NRC is considering the issuance of an order under 10 CFR 50.80 
approving the direct transfer of control of RFOL No. DPR-20 for PNP and 
the general license for the Palisades ISFSI, from HDI to Palisades 
Energy, LLC, which would be the new licensed operator. The application 
states that this proposed transfer of operating authority would be 
conditioned on HDI's receipt of the NRC approvals necessary to resume 
full-power operation of PNP. Thus, implementation of the proposed 
direct transfer of control of the license, would make Palisades Energy, 
LLC, responsible for the operation and maintenance of PNP as licensed 
for full-power reactor operation. The proposed transfer would also 
involve the issuance of a conforming license amendment.
    According to the application, HDI is requesting NRC approval to 
transfer operational authority to Palisades Energy, LLC, and to vest in 
Palisades Energy, LLC, exclusive control of operation and maintenance 
of PNP. Palisades Energy, LLC, is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary 
of Holtec International, formed, staffed, and resourced by Holtec 
International specifically for power operations of PNP. As described in 
the application, Palisades Energy, LLC, will be resourced with the 
appropriate operational experience and the programmatic expertise to 
conduct licensed power operations activities at PNP. Holtec Palisades, 
LLC, will remain the licensed owner, the beneficiary of the PNP 
decommissioning trust fund, and the party to the Standard Contract for 
Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel. No changes are being made to the Big 
Rock Point license, which will remain owned by Holtec Palisades, LLC, 
and operated by HDI. No physical changes to the Palisades Nuclear Plant 
or Palisades ISFSI are being proposed in the transfer application.
    The scope of this notice is limited to comments, requests for a 
hearing, and petitions for leave to intervene related to the proposed 
direct transfer of control of the PNP RFOL No. DPR-20 and the Palisades 
ISFSI general license from HDI to Palisades Energy, LLC. The four 
license amendment requests associated with potential reauthorization of 
power operations at PNP are available for comment, as well as the 
opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene, 
in a separate notice published in today's issue of the Federal 
Register.
    The NRC staff also notes that, although the transfer application 
states that a categorical exclusion applies to the proposed transfer, 
the NRC staff is not relying on a categorical exclusion for this action 
but is instead preparing an environmental assessment (EA) to evaluate 
the environmental impacts from the proposed Federal actions related to 
reauthorizing power operations at PNP, which include the proposed 
license transfer. The NRC's decision to prepare an EA and additional 
detail about the environmental review are discussed in the NRC's notice 
of intent to prepare an EA and conduct scoping, published on June 27, 
2024 (89 FR 53659).
    The NRC's regulations at 10 CFR 50.80 state that no license for a 
production or utilization facility, or any right thereunder, shall be 
transferred, directly or indirectly, through transfer of control of the 
license, unless the Commission gives its consent in writing. The 
Commission will approve an application for the transfer of a license if 
the Commission determines that the proposed transferee is qualified to 
hold the license, and that the transfer is otherwise consistent with 
applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued by the 
Commission.
    Before issuance of the proposed conforming license amendment, the 
Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations.
    As provided in 10 CFR 2.1315, unless otherwise determined by the 
Commission with regard to a specific application, the Commission has 
determined that any amendment to the license of a utilization facility, 
or to the

[[Page 64495]]

license of an ISFSI, which does no more than conform the license to 
reflect the transfer action involves no significant hazards 
consideration and no genuine issue as to whether the health and safety 
of the public will be significantly affected. No contrary determination 
has been made with respect to this specific license amendment 
application. In light of the generic determination reflected in 10 CFR 
2.1315, no public comments with respect to significant hazards 
considerations are being solicited, notwithstanding the general comment 
procedures contained in 10 CFR 50.91.

III. Opportunity to Comment

    Within 30 days from the date of publication of this notice, persons 
may submit written comments regarding the license transfer application, 
as provided for in 10 CFR 2.1305. The Commission will consider and, if 
appropriate, respond to these comments, but such comments will not 
otherwise constitute part of the decisional record. Comments should be 
submitted as described in the ADDRESSES section of this document.

IV. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 20 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 20 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 20 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

V. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions in 
adjudicatory proceedings is located in the ``Electronic Information 
Exchange System Adjudicatory User's Guide'' (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23150A083) and on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-

[[Page 64496]]

issued digital ID certificate as previously described, click ``cancel''

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-255; NRC-2024-0130]


Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC, and Holtec Palisades, 
LLC; Palisades Nuclear Plant; Applications for Amendments to Renewed 
Facility Operating License Involving Proposed No Significant Hazards 
Considerations and Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information and Safeguards Information

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: License amendment requests; opportunity to comment, request a 
hearing, and petition for leave to intervene; order.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission) 
received and is considering issuance of four amendments to Renewed 
Facility Operating License (RFOL) No. DPR-20, that were requested by 
Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), on behalf of Holtec 
Palisades, LLC, to support the potential reauthorization of power 
operations at the Palisades Nuclear Plant (PNP). For each amendment 
request, the NRC proposes to determine that they involve

[[Page 64487]]

no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because potential parties 
may deem it necessary to obtain access to sensitive unclassified non-
safeguards information (SUNSI) and safeguards information (SGI) to meet 
Commission requirements for intervention, the NRC is issuing an order 
imposing procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and SGI for contention 
preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave 
to intervene.

DATES: Comments must be filed by September 6, 2024. A request for a 
hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed by October 7, 
2024. Any potential party as defined in section 2.4 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) who believes access to SUNSI and/
or SGI is necessary to respond to this notice must request document 
access by August 19, 2024.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by any of the following methods; 
however, the NRC encourages electronic comment submission through the 
Federal rulemaking website.

II. Background

A. Background

    PNP consists of a single pressurized-water reactor located in 
Covert Township, Michigan, along the shoreline of Lake Michigan. 
Originally licensed for operation on March 24, 1971, the NRC issued a 
renewed operating license for PNP on January 17, 2007, with the renewed 
operating license term expiring on March 24, 2031.
    On June 13, 2022, Entergy Operations, Inc., the licensee who 
operated the facility prior to transfer of control of the PNP license 
to HDI and Holtec Palisades, LLC, submitted certifications that it had 
permanently ceased operations of PNP and permanently removed fuel from 
the reactor vessel in accordance with paragraph 10 CFR 50.82(a)(1). 
When the NRC docketed the certifications, the PNP RFOL No. DPR-20 no 
longer authorized operation of the reactor, or emplacement or retention 
of fuel into the reactor vessel, as provided by 10 CFR 50.82(a)(2).
    HDI is seeking to return PNP to power operations and has submitted 
several requests for NRC approval to support allowing the resumption of 
power operations through March 24, 2031, the end of the renewed 
facility operating license term under PNP RFOL No. DPR-20. These 
requests include four license amendment requests, which are the subject 
of this notice, a license transfer request, and an exemption request. 
The hearing opportunity for the license transfer request is being 
addressed by a separate notice published in today's issue of the 
Federal Register. Consistent with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, and NRC regulations, the NRC is not publishing a notice of 
opportunity for hearing on the exemption request.

B. License Amendment Requests

    The NRC is considering issuance of amendments to RFOL No. DPR-20 
that were requested by HDI, on behalf of Holtec Palisades, LLC, to 
support reauthorization of commercial power operations at PNP. These 
license amendment requests are the subject of this notice and are 
listed in tabular form in Section III of this document.
    Before any issuance of the proposed license amendments, the NRC 
will need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended (the Act), and the NRC's regulations. Pursuant to 
Section 189a.(2) of the Act, the NRC is publishing this notice. The Act 
requires the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued or 
proposed to be issued, and grants the Commission the authority to issue 
and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or 
combined license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission 
that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, 
notwithstanding

[[Page 64488]]

the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any 
person.
    The scope of this notice is limited to comments, requests for a 
hearing, and petitions for leave to intervene related to the four 
proposed license amendment requests listed in tabular form in Section 
III of this document. The proposed direct transfer of the PNP license 
from HDI to Palisades Energy, LLC, is available for comment, as well as 
the opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene, in a separate notice published in today's issue of the 
Federal Register.
    The NRC staff also notes that, although the four amendment requests 
state that a categorical exclusion applies to the requested amendments, 
the NRC staff is not relying on a categorical exclusion for these 
actions but is instead preparing an environmental assessment (EA) to 
evaluate the environmental impacts from the proposed Federal actions 
related to reauthorizing power operations at PNP, which include the 
license amendment requests. The NRC's decision to prepare an EA and 
additional detail about the environmental review are discussed in the 
NRC's notice of intent to prepare an EA and conduct scoping, published 
on June 27, 2024 (89 FR 53659).

III. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Renewed 
Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards 
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing

    The Commission has made a proposed determination that the four 
amendment requests listed in this notice involve no significant hazards 
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this 
means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed 
amendments would not (1) involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction 
in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for 
each amendment request is included in the license amendment requests as 
referenced in tabular form in Section III of this document.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. In addition, 
the Commission may issue any of these amendments prior to the 
expiration of the 30-day comment period if circumstances change during 
the 30-day comment period such that failure to act in a timely way 
would result, for example, in prevention of resumption of operation of 
the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of these amendments 
prior to the expiration of either the comment period or the notice 
period, it will publish a notice of issuance in the Federal Register. 
If the Commission makes a final no significant hazards consideration 
determination for any of these amendments, any hearing will take place 
after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this 
action on any amendment before 60 days have elapsed will occur very 
infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 
CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on 
the petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions in 
adjudicatory proceedings is located in the ``Electronic Information 
Exchange System Adjudicatory User's Guide'' (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23150A083) and on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10

[[Page 64489]]

days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    The following table provides the topic and dates of each 
application, ADAMS accession number(s), and location in the application 
of HDI's proposed NSHC determination for each of the license amendment 
requests that support resumption of commercial power operation at PNP. 
For further details with respect to these license amendment 
applications, see the applications for amendment, publicly available 
portions of which are available for public inspection in ADAMS. For 
additional direction on accessing information related to these 
documents, see the ``Obtaining Information and Submitting Comments''

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information and Safeguards Information for Contention 
Preparation

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing SUNSI and 
SGI. Requirements for access to SGI are primarily set forth in 10 CFR 
parts 2 and 73. Nothing in this Order is intended to conflict with the 
SGI regulations.
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of opportunity 
for hearing, any potential party who believes access to SUNSI and/or 
SGI is necessary to respond to this notice may request such access. A 
``potential party'' is any person who intends to participate as a party 
by demonstrating standing and filing an admissible contention under 10 
CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI and/or SGI submitted later than 
10 days after publication will not be considered absent a showing of 
good cause for the late filing, addressing why the request could not 
have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI, SGI, or both to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: 
Rulemakings and Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy 
General Counsel for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the 
General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 
20555-0001. The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both 
offices is: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, 
Rockville, Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the 
Secretary and the Office of the General Counsel are 
[email protected] and [email protected], 
respectively.\1\ The request must include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI and/or SGI 
under these procedures should be submitted as described in this 
paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice.
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1).
    (3) If the request is for SUNSI, the identity of the individual or 
entity requesting access to SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the 
need for the information in order to meaningfully participate in this 
adjudicatory proceeding. In particular, the request must explain why 
publicly available versions of the information requested would not be 
sufficient to provide the basis and specificity for a proffered 
contention.
    (4) If the request is for SGI, the identity of each individual who 
would have access to SGI if the request is granted, including the 
identity of any expert, consultant, or assistant who will aid the 
requestor in evaluating the SGI. In addition, the request must contain 
the following information:
    (a) A statement that explains each individual's ``need to know'' 
the SGI, as required by 10 CFR 73.2 and 10 CFR 73.22(b)(1). Consistent 
with the definition of ``need to know'' as stated in 10 CFR 73.2, the 
statement must explain:
    (i) Specifically, why the requestor believes that the information 
is necessary to enable the requestor to proffer and/or adjudicate a 
specific contention in this proceeding; \2\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Broad SGI requests under these procedures are unlikely to 
meet the standard for need to know; furthermore, NRC staff redaction 
of information from requested documents before their release may be 
appropriate to comport with this requirement. These procedures do 
not authorize unrestricted disclosure or less scrutiny of a 
requestor's need to know than ordinarily would be applied in 
connection with an already-admitted contention or non-adjudicatory 
access to SGI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The technical competence (demonstrable knowledge, skill, 
training or education) of the requestor to effectively utilize the 
requested SGI to provide the basis and specificity for a proffered 
contention. The technical competence of a potential party or its 
counsel may be shown by reliance on a

[[Page 64491]]

qualified expert, consultant, or assistant who satisfies these 
criteria.
    (b) A completed Form SF-85, ``Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive 
Positions,'' for each individual who would have access to SGI. The 
completed Form SF-85 will be used by the Office of Administration to 
conduct the background check required for access to SGI, as required by 
10 CFR part 2, subpart C, and 10 CFR 73.22(b)(2), to determine the 
requestor's trustworthiness and reliability. For security reasons, Form 
SF-85 can only be submitted electronically through the National 
Background Investigation Services e-App system, a secure website that 
is owned and operated by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security 
Agency (DCSA). To obtain online access to the form, the requestor 
should contact the NRC's Office of Administration at 301-415-3710.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The requestor will be asked to provide the requestor's full 
name, social security number, date and place of birth, telephone 
number, and email address. After providing this information, the 
requestor usually should be able to obtain access to the online form 
within one business day.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) A completed Form FD-258 (fingerprint card), signed in original 
ink, and submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 73.57(d). Copies of Form 
FD-258 will be provided in the background check request package 
supplied by the Office of Administration for each individual for whom a 
background check is being requested. The fingerprint card will be used 
to satisfy the requirements of 10 CFR part 2, subpart C, 10 CFR 
73.22(b)(1), and Section 149 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, which mandates that all persons with access to SGI must be 
fingerprinted for a Federal Bureau of Investigation identification and 
criminal history records check.
    (d) A check or money order payable in the amount of $310.00 \4\ to 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for each individual for whom the 
request for access has been submitted, and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ This fee is subject to change pursuant to the DCSA's 
adjustable billing rates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) If the requestor or any individual(s) who will have access to 
SGI believes they belong to one or more of the categories of 
individuals in 10 CFR 73.59 that are exempt from the criminal history 
records check and background check requirements, the requestor should 
also provide a statement identifying which exemption the requestor is 
invoking and explaining the requestor's basis for believing that the 
exemption applies. While processing the request, the Office of 
Administration, Personnel Security Branch, will make a final 
determination whether the claimed exemption applies. Alternatively, the 
requestor may contact the Office of Administration for an evaluation of 
their exemption status prior to submitting their request. Persons who 
are exempt from the background check are not required to complete the 
SF-85 or Form FD-258; however, all other requirements for access to 
SGI, including the need to know, are still applicable.

    Note: Copies of documents and materials required by paragraphs 
C.(4)(b), (c), and (d) of this Order must be sent to the following 
address: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of 
Administration, ATTN: Personnel Security Branch, Mail Stop: TWFN-
07D04M, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.

    These documents and materials should not be included with the 
request letter to the Office of the Secretary, but the request letter 
should state that the forms and fees have been submitted as required.
    D. To avoid delays in processing requests for access to SGI, the 
requestor should review all submitted materials for completeness and 
accuracy (including legibility) before submitting them to the NRC. The 
NRC will return incomplete packages to the sender without processing.
    E. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraphs C.(3) or C.(4), as applicable, the NRC staff will determine 
within 10 days of receipt of the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI and/or a need to know the SGI requested.
    F. For requests for access to SUNSI, if the NRC staff determines 
that the requestor has satisfied both E.(1) and E.(2), the NRC staff 
will notify the requestor in writing that access to SUNSI has been 
granted. The written notification will contain instructions on how the 
requestor may obtain copies of the requested documents, and any other 
conditions that may apply to access to those documents. These 
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the signing of a Non-
Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or Protective Order \5\ setting 
forth terms and conditions to prevent the unauthorized or inadvertent 
disclosure of SUNSI by each individual who will be granted access to 
SUNSI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer, or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    G. For requests for access to SGI, if the NRC staff determines that 
the requestor has satisfied both E.(1) and E.(2), the Office of 
Administration will then determine, based upon completion of the 
background check, whether the proposed recipient is trustworthy and 
reliable, as required for access to SGI by 10 CFR 73.22(b). If the 
Office of Administration determines that the individual or individuals 
are trustworthy and reliable, the NRC will promptly notify the 
requestor in writing. The notification will provide the names of 
approved individuals as well as the conditions under which the SGI will 
be provided. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, the 
signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or Protective Order 
\6\ by each individual who will be granted access to SGI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non- Disclosure 
Agreement or Affidavit for SGI must be filed with the presiding 
officer, or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 180 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    H. Release and Storage of SGI. Prior to providing SGI to the 
requestor, the NRC staff will conduct (as necessary) an inspection to 
confirm that the recipient's information protection system is 
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 10 CFR 73.22. Alternatively, 
recipients may opt to view SGI at an approved SGI storage location 
rather than establish their own SGI protection program to meet SGI 
protection requirements.
    I. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI and/or SGI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 
days after receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more 
than 25 days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) 
the information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of opportunity for hearing), the petitioner 
may file its SUNSI and/or SGI contentions by that later deadline.
    J. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI and/or SGI is denied by the 
NRC staff either after a determination on standing and requisite need, 
or after a determination on trustworthiness and reliability, the NRC 
staff shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly 
stating the reason or reasons for the denial.

[[Page 64492]]

    (2) Before the Office of Administration makes a final adverse 
determination regarding the trustworthiness and reliability of the 
proposed recipient(s) for access to SGI, the Office of Administration, 
in accordance with 10 CFR 2.336(f)(1)(iii), must provide the proposed 
recipient(s) any records that were considered in the trustworthiness 
and reliability determination, including those required to be provided 
under 10 CFR 73.57(e)(1), so that the proposed recipient(s) have an 
opportunity to correct or explain the record.
    (3) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination regarding access to SUNSI or with respect to standing or 
need to know for SGI by filing a challenge within 5 days of receipt of 
that determination with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    (4) The requestor may challenge the Office of Administration's 
final adverse determination with respect to trustworthiness and 
reliability for access to SGI by filing a request for review in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.336(f)(1)(iv).
    (5) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    K. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest independent of the proceeding. 
Such a challenge must be filed within 5 days of the notification by the 
NRC staff of its grant of access and must be filed with: (a) the 
presiding officer designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another administrative judge or an 
Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); 
or (c) if another officer has been designated to rule on information 
access issues, with that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or denying access) is governed by 10 
CFR 2.311.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562, August 3, 2012) apply to appeals of NRC staff 
determinations (because they must be served on a presiding officer 
or the Commission, as applicable), but not to the initial SUNSI and/
or SGI request submitted to the NRC staff under these procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    L. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests 
for access to SUNSI and/or SGI, and motions for protective orders, in a 
timely fashion in order to minimize any unnecessary delays in 
identifying those petitioners who have standing and who have propounded 
contentions meeting the specificity and basis requirements in 10 CFR 
part 2. The attachment to this Order summarizes the general target 
schedule for processing and resolving requests under these procedures.
    It is so ordered.

    Dated: August 1, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

                            for a proffered contention; and (iv)
                            including the application and fee for the

                            intervention; +7 requestor/petitioner
                            reply).
20.......................  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
                            staff informs the requestor of the staff's
                            determination whether the request for access
                            provides a reasonable basis to believe
                            standing can be established and shows (1)
                            need for SUNSI and/or (2) need to know SGI.
                            (For SUNSI, NRC staff also informs any party
                            to the proceeding whose interest independent
                            of the proceeding would be harmed by the
                            release of the information.) If NRC staff
                            makes the finding of need for SUNSI and
                            likelihood of standing, NRC staff begins
                            document processing (preparation of
                            redactions or review of redacted documents).
                           If NRC staff makes the finding of need to
                            know for SGI and likelihood of standing, NRC
                            staff begins background check (including
                            fingerprinting for a criminal history
                            records check), information processing

                            redacted documents), and readiness
                            inspections.
25.......................  If NRC staff finds no ``need'' for SUNSI and/
                            or no ``need to know'' for SGI, or no
                            likelihood of standing, the deadline for
                            requestor/petitioner to file a motion
                            seeking a ruling to reverse the NRC staff's
                            denial of access; NRC staff files copy of

                            whose interest independent of the proceeding
                            would be harmed by the release of the
                            information to file a motion seeking a
                            ruling to reverse the NRC staff's grant of
                            access.

                            reliable). Note: Before the Office of
                            Administration makes a final adverse
                            determination regarding access to SGI, the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Three Mile Island Nuclear Station (TMINS) is approximately 16 
kilometers (10 miles) southeast of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The TMINS 
site includes Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 1 and TMI-2. It 
encompasses approximately 178 hectares (440 acres), including the 
adjacent islands on the north end, a strip of land on the mainland 
along the eastern shore of the river, and an area on the eastern shore 
of Shelley Island. The TMINS site has significance in U.S. history 
because it is the site of the nation's most serious commercial nuclear 
power plant accident, occurring at TMI-2. On March 28, 1979, TMI-2 
experienced an accident initiated by interruption of secondary 
feedwater flow which led to a core heat up that caused fuel damage. The 
partial meltdown of the reactor core led to a very small offsite 
release of radioactivity. In response to this accident many changes 
occurred at nuclear power plants including emergency response planning, 
reactor operator training, human factors engineering, radiation 
protection and heightened NRC regulatory oversight.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated February 22, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23058A064), TMI-2Solutions requested an amendment to POL No. DPR-73. 
TMI-2Solutions will be engaging in certain major decommissioning 
activities, including the physical demolition of buildings previously 
deemed eligible for the NRHP. Because the impacts on the historic 
properties from these decommissioning activities have not been 
previously evaluated and are not bounded by the impact's discussion in 
NUREG-0586, ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement on 
Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities,'' TMI-2Solutions requested an 
amendment that would require evaluation of the impacts of the 
decommissioning activities on the NRHP-eligible properties, in 
compliance with paragraph 50.82(a)(6)(ii) of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR).
    Pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8, the NRC used its National Environmental 
Policy Act process for developing the EA to facilitate consultation 
pursuant to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act 
(NHPA).
    Adverse effects to historic properties would result from 
decommissioning activities at TMI-2. Therefore, the NRC and consulting 
parties proceeded with development of a programmatic agreement (PA) to 
resolve adverse effects. The draft PA was issued for public comment 
through a Federal Register notice dated March 6, 2024 (89 FR 16037). 
One comment was received and considered before finalizing the PA. The 
PA addresses the potential direct and indirect adverse effects from the 
decommissioning activities and ensures that appropriate mitigation 
measures are implemented. The NRC's EA references the final PA and, 
therefore, conclude NHPA section 106 consultation.
    In accordance with NRC's regulations in 10 CFR part 51, 
``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions,'' that implement the National Environment 
Protection Agency (NEPA), the NRC staff has prepared an EA documenting 
its environmental review of the license amendment application. Based on 
the environmental review, the NRC has made a determination that the 
proposed action will not significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment and that a FONSI is therefore appropriate.

III. Summary of Environmental Assessment

    The EA is publicly available in ADAMS under Accession No. 
ML24197A005. A summary description of the proposed action and expected 
environmental impacts is provided as follows.

[[Page 64965]]

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action is to amend POL No. DPR-73 so that TMI-
2Solutions can continue with certain major decommissioning activities 
planned under Phase 2 of its decommissioning schedule. Phase 2 
decommissioning activities include the removal of any radioactive 
components in preparation for demolition of structures, decommissioning 
and dismantlement of the TMI-2 site to a level that permits the release 
of the site, except for an area potentially to be set aside for storage 
of fuel-bearing material (small quantities of spent nuclear fuel, 
damaged core material, and high-level waste) on the independent spent 
fuel storage installation, backfilling of the site, license termination 
plan submittal and implementation, and site restoration activities. In 
order to comply with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(6)(ii), TMI-2Solutions requested 
that NRC evaluate the impacts of certain major decommissioning 
activities on historic and cultural resources and NRHP-eligible 
properties. The definition of major decommissioning activity is in 10 
CFR 50.2, which states ``major decommissioning activity means, for a 
nuclear power reactor facility, any activity that results in permanent 
removal of major radioactive components, permanently modifies the 
structure of the containment, or results in dismantling components for 
shipment containing greater than class C waste in accordance with Sec.  
61.55 of this chapter.'' Due to radioactive contamination, the TMI-2 
structures must be demolished and removed during decommissioning.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    In the EA, the staff assessed the potential environmental impacts 
from the proposed license amendment to the following resource areas: 
land use; visual and scenic resources; the geologic environment; 
surface and groundwater resources; ecological resources; air quality; 
noise; historic and cultural resources; socioeconomic conditions; 
environmental justice; public and occupational health; transportation; 
and waste generation and management. The NRC staff also considered the 
cumulative impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
actions when combined with the proposed action. The TMI-2 Historic 
District would be adversely affected by the TMI-2 decommissioning, and 
adverse effects cannot be avoided. The mitigation of adverse effects to 
the TMI-2 Historic District will be completed in accordance with the 
TMI-2 Demolition and Decommissioning Programmatic Agreement (NRC 
2024a).
    As part of the NRC's consultation under section 7 of the Endangered 
Species Act, NRC staff determined that the proposed action may affect 
but is not likely to adversely affect the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), 
northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), tricolored bat 
(Perimyotis subflavus), monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), 
northeastern bulrush (Scirpus ancistrochaetus), or green floater 
(Lasmigona subviridis). The NRC staff transmitted a letter to the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for its review and concurrence on May 
24, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24120A324). The FWS concurred with the 
NRC's findings on July 15, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24199A062).
    All other potential impacts from the proposed action were 
determined to be not significant, as described in the EA. The NRC staff 
found that there would be no significant negative cumulative impact to 
any resource area from the proposed action when added to other past, 
present, and reasonably foreseeable actions.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternative to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC staff considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Under the no-action alternative, the NRC would deny the licensee's 
request to allow for the continuation of major decommissioning 
activities under Phase 2. In this case, the NRC staff would not review 
the historic and cultural resource impacts of the major decommissioning 
activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.2 and would therefore disallow the 
removal of NRHP-eligible structures and any impacts to historic and 
cultural resources. However, due to the presence of radioactive 
contamination, TMI-2 structures, including the NRHP-eligible 
structures, must be removed during the decommissioning process. 
Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that denying the amendment request 
is not a reasonable alternative.

IV. Finding of No Significant Impact

    In accordance with the NEPA and 10 CFR part 51, the NRC staff has 
conducted an environmental review of a request for an amendment to POL 
No. DPR-73. The proposed amendment would revise the POL to allow the 
licensee to conduct decommissioning at TMI-2 covering activities that 
were not previously addressed in the staff's environmental assessments 
(site-specific historical and cultural resources). Based on its 
environmental review of the proposed action, the NRC staff has made a 
finding of no significant impact in the EA. Therefore, the NRC staff 
has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, that preparation of an 
environmental impact statement is not required for the proposed action 
and a FONSI is appropriate.

II. Introduction

A. Background

    PNP consists of a single pressurized-water reactor located in 
Covert Township, Michigan, along the shoreline of Lake Michigan. 
Originally licensed for operation on March 24, 1971, the NRC issued a 
renewed operating license for PNP on January 17, 2007, with the renewed 
operating license term expiring on March 24, 2031.
    On June 13, 2022, Entergy Operations, Inc., the licensee who 
operated the facility prior to transfer of control of the PNP license 
to HDI and Holtec Palisades, LLC, submitted certifications that it had 
permanently ceased operations of PNP and permanently removed fuel from 
the reactor vessel in accordance with paragraph 50.82(a)(1) of title 10 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). When the NRC docketed the 
certifications, the PNP RFOL No. DPR-20 no longer authorized operation 
of the reactor, or emplacement or retention of fuel into the reactor 
vessel, as provided by 10 CFR 50.82(a)(2).
    HDI is seeking to return PNP to power operations and has submitted 
several requests for NRC approval to support allowing the resumption of 
power operations through March 24, 2031, the end of the renewed 
facility operating license term under PNP RFOL No. DPR-20. These 
requests include the license transfer application, which is the subject 
of this notice, and four license amendment requests. The hearing 
opportunity for the four license amendment requests is being addressed 
by a separate notice published in today's issue of the Federal 
Register.

B. Transfer Request

    The NRC is considering the issuance of an order under 10 CFR 50.80 
approving the direct transfer of control of RFOL No. DPR-20 for PNP and 
the general license for the Palisades ISFSI, from HDI to Palisades 
Energy, LLC, which would be the new licensed operator. The application 
states that this proposed transfer of operating authority would be 
conditioned on HDI's receipt of the NRC approvals necessary to resume 
full-power operation of PNP. Thus, implementation of the proposed 
direct transfer of control of the license, would make Palisades Energy, 
LLC, responsible for the operation and maintenance of PNP as licensed 
for full-power reactor operation. The proposed transfer would also 
involve the issuance of a conforming license amendment.
    According to the application, HDI is requesting NRC approval to 
transfer operational authority to Palisades Energy, LLC, and to vest in 
Palisades Energy, LLC, exclusive control of operation and maintenance 
of PNP. Palisades Energy, LLC, is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary 
of Holtec International, formed, staffed, and resourced by Holtec 
International specifically for power operations of PNP. As described in 
the application, Palisades Energy, LLC, will be resourced with the 
appropriate operational experience and the programmatic expertise to 
conduct licensed power operations activities at PNP. Holtec Palisades, 
LLC, will remain the licensed owner, the beneficiary of the PNP 
decommissioning trust fund, and the party to the Standard Contract for 
Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel. No changes are being made to the Big 
Rock Point license, which will remain owned by Holtec Palisades, LLC, 
and operated by HDI. No physical changes to the Palisades Nuclear Plant 
or Palisades ISFSI are being proposed in the transfer application.
    The scope of this notice is limited to comments, requests for a 
hearing, and petitions for leave to intervene related to the proposed 
direct transfer of control of the PNP RFOL No. DPR-20 and the Palisades 
ISFSI general license from HDI to Palisades Energy, LLC. The four 
license amendment requests associated with potential reauthorization of 
power operations at PNP are available for comment, as well as the 
opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene, 
in a separate notice published in today's issue of the Federal 
Register.
    The NRC staff also notes that, although the transfer application 
states that a categorical exclusion applies to the proposed transfer, 
the NRC staff is not relying on a categorical exclusion for this action 
but is instead preparing an environmental assessment (EA) to evaluate 
the environmental impacts from the proposed Federal actions related to 
reauthorizing power operations at PNP, which include the proposed 
license transfer. The NRC's decision to prepare an EA and additional 
detail about the environmental review are discussed in the NRC's notice 
of intent to prepare an EA and conduct scoping, published on June 27, 
2024 (89 FR 53659).
    The NRC's regulations at 10 CFR 50.80 state that no license for a 
production or utilization facility, or any right thereunder, shall be 
transferred, directly or indirectly, through transfer of control of the 
license, unless the Commission gives its consent in writing. The 
Commission will approve an application for the transfer of a license if 
the Commission determines that the proposed transferee is qualified to 
hold the license, and that the transfer is otherwise consistent with 
applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued by the 
Commission.
    Before issuance of the proposed conforming license amendment, the 
Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations.
    As provided in 10 CFR 2.1315, unless otherwise determined by the 
Commission with regard to a specific application, the Commission has 
determined that any amendment to the license of a utilization facility, 
or to the

[[Page 64495]]

license of an ISFSI, which does no more than conform the license to 
reflect the transfer action involves no significant hazards 
consideration and no genuine issue as to whether the health and safety 
of the public will be significantly affected. No contrary determination 
has been made with respect to this specific license amendment 
application. In light of the generic determination reflected in 10 CFR 
2.1315, no public comments with respect to significant hazards 
considerations are being solicited, notwithstanding the general comment 
procedures contained in 10 CFR 50.91.

III. Opportunity to Comment

    Within 30 days from the date of publication of this notice, persons 
may submit written comments regarding the license transfer application, 
as provided for in 10 CFR 2.1305. The Commission will consider and, if 
appropriate, respond to these comments, but such comments will not 
otherwise constitute part of the decisional record. Comments should be 
submitted as described in the ADDRESSES section of this document.

IV. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 20 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 20 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 20 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

V. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions in 
adjudicatory proceedings is located in the ``Electronic Information 
Exchange System Adjudicatory User's Guide'' (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23150A083) and on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-

[[Page 64496]]

issued digital ID certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' 
when the link requests certificates and you will be automatically 
directed to the NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able 
to access any publicly available documents in a particular hearing 
docket. Participants are requested not to include personal privacy 
information such as social security numbers, home addresses, or 
personal phone numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or 
other law requires submission of such information. With respect to 
copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose 
of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use 
application, participants should not include copyrighted materials in 
their submission.
    The Commission will issue a notice or order granting or denying a 
hearing request or intervention petition, designating the issues for 
any hearing that will be held and designating the Presiding Officer. A 
notice granting a hearing will be published in the Federal Register and 
served on the parties to the hearing.
    For further details with respect to this application, see the 
application dated December 6, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23340A161), 
as supplemented on May 23, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24144A106).

VI. Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information for 
Contention Preparation

    Any person who desires access to proprietary, confidential 
commercial information that has been redacted from the application 
should contact the applicant by telephoning Jason Day, HDI General 
Counsel, at 856-797-0900, extension 3688, or [email protected] for the 
purpose of negotiating a confidentiality agreement or a proposed 
protective order with the applicant. If no agreement can be reached, 
persons who desire access to this information may file a motion with 
the Secretary and addressed to the Commission that requests the 
issuance of a protective order.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-255; NRC-2024-0130]


Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC, and Holtec Palisades, 
LLC; Palisades Nuclear Plant; Applications for Amendments to Renewed 
Facility Operating License Involving Proposed No Significant Hazards 
Considerations and Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information and Safeguards Information

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: License amendment requests; opportunity to comment, request a 
hearing, and petition for leave to intervene; order.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission) 
received and is considering issuance of four amendments to Renewed 
Facility Operating License (RFOL) No. DPR-20, that were requested by 
Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), on behalf of Holtec 
Palisades, LLC, to support the potential reauthorization of power 
operations at the Palisades Nuclear Plant (PNP). For each amendment 
request, the NRC proposes to determine that they involve

[[Page 64487]]

no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). Because potential parties 
may deem it necessary to obtain access to sensitive unclassified non-
safeguards information (SUNSI) and safeguards information (SGI) to meet 
Commission requirements for intervention, the NRC is issuing an order 
imposing procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and SGI for contention 
preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave 
to intervene.

DATES: Comments must be filed by September 6, 2024. A request for a 
hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed by October 7, 
2024. Any potential party as defined in section 2.4 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) who believes access to SUNSI and/
or SGI is necessary to respond to this notice must request document 
access by August 19, 2024.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by any of the following methods; 
however, the NRC encourages electronic comment submission through the 
Federal rulemaking website.
     Federal rulemaking website: Go to https://www.regulations.gov and search for Docket ID NRC-2024-0130. Address 
questions about Docket IDs in Regulations.gov to Stacy Schumann;

II. Background

A. Background

    PNP consists of a single pressurized-water reactor located in 
Covert Township, Michigan, along the shoreline of Lake Michigan. 
Originally licensed for operation on March 24, 1971, the NRC issued a 
renewed operating license for PNP on January 17, 2007, with the renewed 
operating license term expiring on March 24, 2031.
    On June 13, 2022, Entergy Operations, Inc., the licensee who 
operated the facility prior to transfer of control of the PNP license 
to HDI and Holtec Palisades, LLC, submitted certifications that it had 
permanently ceased operations of PNP and permanently removed fuel from 
the reactor vessel in accordance with paragraph 10 CFR 50.82(a)(1). 
When the NRC docketed the certifications, the PNP RFOL No. DPR-20 no 
longer authorized operation of the reactor, or emplacement or retention 
of fuel into the reactor vessel, as provided by 10 CFR 50.82(a)(2).
    HDI is seeking to return PNP to power operations and has submitted 
several requests for NRC approval to support allowing the resumption of 
power operations through March 24, 2031, the end of the renewed 
facility operating license term under PNP RFOL No. DPR-20. These 
requests include four license amendment requests, which are the subject 
of this notice, a license transfer request, and an exemption request. 
The hearing opportunity for the license transfer request is being 
addressed by a separate notice published in today's issue of the 
Federal Register. Consistent with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, and NRC regulations, the NRC is not publishing a notice of 
opportunity for hearing on the exemption request.

B. License Amendment Requests

    The NRC is considering issuance of amendments to RFOL No. DPR-20 
that were requested by HDI, on behalf of Holtec Palisades, LLC, to 
support reauthorization of commercial power operations at PNP. These 
license amendment requests are the subject of this notice and are 
listed in tabular form in Section III of this document.
    Before any issuance of the proposed license amendments, the NRC 
will need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended (the Act), and the NRC's regulations. Pursuant to 
Section 189a.(2) of the Act, the NRC is publishing this notice. The Act 
requires the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued or 
proposed to be issued, and grants the Commission the authority to issue 
and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or 
combined license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission 
that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, 
notwithstanding

[[Page 64488]]

the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any 
person.
    The scope of this notice is limited to comments, requests for a 
hearing, and petitions for leave to intervene related to the four 
proposed license amendment requests listed in tabular form in Section 
III of this document. The proposed direct transfer of the PNP license 
from HDI to Palisades Energy, LLC, is available for comment, as well as 
the opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene, in a separate notice published in today's issue of the 
Federal Register.
    The NRC staff also notes that, although the four amendment requests 
state that a categorical exclusion applies to the requested amendments, 
the NRC staff is not relying on a categorical exclusion for these 
actions but is instead preparing an environmental assessment (EA) to 
evaluate the environmental impacts from the proposed Federal actions 
related to reauthorizing power operations at PNP, which include the 
license amendment requests. The NRC's decision to prepare an EA and 
additional detail about the environmental review are discussed in the 
NRC's notice of intent to prepare an EA and conduct scoping, published 
on June 27, 2024 (89 FR 53659).

III. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Renewed 
Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards 
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing

    The Commission has made a proposed determination that the four 
amendment requests listed in this notice involve no significant hazards 
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this 
means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed 
amendments would not (1) involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction 
in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for 
each amendment request is included in the license amendment requests as 
referenced in tabular form in Section III of this document.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. In addition, 
the Commission may issue any of these amendments prior to the 
expiration of the 30-day comment period if circumstances change during 
the 30-day comment period such that failure to act in a timely way 
would result, for example, in prevention of resumption of operation of 
the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of these amendments 
prior to the expiration of either the comment period or the notice 
period, it will publish a notice of issuance in the Federal Register. 
If the Commission makes a final no significant hazards consideration 
determination for any of these amendments, any hearing will take place 
after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this 
action on any amendment before 60 days have elapsed will occur very 
infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 
CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on 
the petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions in 
adjudicatory proceedings is located in the ``Electronic Information 
Exchange System Adjudicatory User's Guide'' (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23150A083) and on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10

[[Page 64489]]

days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    The following table provides the topic and dates of each 
application, ADAMS accession number(s), and location in the application 
of HDI's proposed NSHC determination for each of the license amendment 
requests that support resumption of commercial power operation at PNP. 
For further details with respect to these license amendment 
applications, see the applications for amendment, publicly available 
portions of which are available for public inspection in ADAMS. For 
additional direction on accessing information related to these 
documents, see the ``Obtaining Information and Submitting Comments'' 
section of this document.

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information and Safeguards Information for Contention 
Preparation

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing SUNSI and 
SGI. Requirements for access to SGI are primarily set forth in 10 CFR 
parts 2 and 73. Nothing in this Order is intended to conflict with the 
SGI regulations.
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of opportunity 
for hearing, any potential party who believes access to SUNSI and/or 
SGI is necessary to respond to this notice may request such access. A 
``potential party'' is any person who intends to participate as a party 
by demonstrating standing and filing an admissible contention under 10 
CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI and/or SGI submitted later than 
10 days after publication will not be considered absent a showing of 
good cause for the late filing, addressing why the request could not 
have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI, SGI, or both to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: 
Rulemakings and Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy 
General Counsel for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the 
General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 
20555-0001. The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both 
offices is: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, 
Rockville, Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the 
Secretary and the Office of the General Counsel are 
[email protected] and [email protected], 
respectively.\1\ The request must include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI and/or SGI 
under these procedures should be submitted as described in this 
paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice.
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1).
    (3) If the request is for SUNSI, the identity of the individual or 
entity requesting access to SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the 
need for the information in order to meaningfully participate in this 
adjudicatory proceeding. In particular, the request must explain why 
publicly available versions of the information requested would not be 
sufficient to provide the basis and specificity for a proffered 
contention.
    (4) If the request is for SGI, the identity of each individual who 
would have access to SGI if the request is granted, including the 
identity of any expert, consultant, or assistant who will aid the 
requestor in evaluating the SGI. In addition, the request must contain 
the following information:
    (a) A statement that explains each individual's ``need to know'' 
the SGI, as required by 10 CFR 73.2 and 10 CFR 73.22(b)(1). Consistent 
with the definition of ``need to know'' as stated in 10 CFR 73.2, the 
statement must explain:
    (i) Specifically, why the requestor believes that the information 
is necessary to enable the requestor to proffer and/or adjudicate a 
specific contention in this proceeding; \2\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Broad SGI requests under these procedures are unlikely to 
meet the standard for need to know; furthermore, NRC staff redaction 
of information from requested documents before their release may be 
appropriate to comport with this requirement. These procedures do 
not authorize unrestricted disclosure or less scrutiny of a 
requestor's need to know than ordinarily would be applied in 
connection with an already-admitted contention or non-adjudicatory 
access to SGI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The technical competence (demonstrable knowledge, skill, 
training or education) of the requestor to effectively utilize the 
requested SGI to provide the basis and specificity for a proffered 
contention. The technical competence of a potential party or its 
counsel may be shown by reliance on a

[[Page 64491]]

qualified expert, consultant, or assistant who satisfies these 
criteria.
    (b) A completed Form SF-85, ``Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive 
Positions,'' for each individual who would have access to SGI. The 
completed Form SF-85 will be used by the Office of Administration to 
conduct the background check required for access to SGI, as required by 
10 CFR part 2, subpart C, and 10 CFR 73.22(b)(2), to determine the 
requestor's trustworthiness and reliability. For security reasons, Form 
SF-85 can only be submitted electronically through the National 
Background Investigation Services e-App system, a secure website that 
is owned and operated by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security 
Agency (DCSA). To obtain online access to the form, the requestor 
should contact the NRC's Office of Administration at 301-415-3710.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The requestor will be asked to provide the requestor's full 
name, social security number, date and place of birth, telephone 
number, and email address. After providing this information, the 
requestor usually should be able to obtain access to the online form 
within one business day.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) A completed Form FD-258 (fingerprint card), signed in original 
ink, and submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 73.57(d). Copies of Form 
FD-258 will be provided in the background check request package 
supplied by the Office of Administration for each individual for whom a 
background check is being requested. The fingerprint card will be used 
to satisfy the requirements of 10 CFR part 2, subpart C, 10 CFR 
73.22(b)(1), and Section 149 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, which mandates that all persons with access to SGI must be 
fingerprinted for a Federal Bureau of Investigation identification and 
criminal history records check.
    (d) A check or money order payable in the amount of $310.00 \4\ to 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for each individual for whom the 
request for access has been submitted, and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ This fee is subject to change pursuant to the DCSA's 
adjustable billing rates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) If the requestor or any individual(s) who will have access to 
SGI believes they belong to one or more of the categories of 
individuals in 10 CFR 73.59 that are exempt from the criminal history 
records check and background check requirements, the requestor should 
also provide a statement identifying which exemption the requestor is 
invoking and explaining the requestor's basis for believing that the 
exemption applies. While processing the request, the Office of 
Administration, Personnel Security Branch, will make a final 
determination whether the claimed exemption applies. Alternatively, the 
requestor may contact the Office of Administration for an evaluation of 
their exemption status prior to submitting their request. Persons who 
are exempt from the background check are not required to complete the 
SF-85 or Form FD-258; however, all other requirements for access to 
SGI, including the need to know, are still applicable.

    Note: Copies of documents and materials required by paragraphs 
C.(4)(b), (c), and (d) of this Order must be sent to the following 
address: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of 
Administration, ATTN: Personnel Security Branch, Mail Stop: TWFN-
07D04M, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852.

    These documents and materials should not be included with the 
request letter to the Office of the Secretary, but the request letter 
should state that the forms and fees have been submitted as required.
    D. To avoid delays in processing requests for access to SGI, the 
requestor should review all submitted materials for completeness and 
accuracy (including legibility) before submitting them to the NRC. The 
NRC will return incomplete packages to the sender without processing.
    E. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraphs C.(3) or C.(4), as applicable, the NRC staff will determine 
within 10 days of receipt of the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI and/or a need to know the SGI requested.
    F. For requests for access to SUNSI, if the NRC staff determines 
that the requestor has satisfied both E.(1) and E.(2), the NRC staff 
will notify the requestor in writing that access to SUNSI has been 
granted. The written notification will contain instructions on how the 
requestor may obtain copies of the requested documents, and any other 
conditions that may apply to access to those documents. These 
conditions may include, but are not limited to, the signing of a Non-
Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or Protective Order \5\ setting 
forth terms and conditions to prevent the unauthorized or inadvertent 
disclosure of SUNSI by each individual who will be granted access to 
SUNSI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer, or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    G. For requests for access to SGI, if the NRC staff determines that 
the requestor has satisfied both E.(1) and E.(2), the Office of 
Administration will then determine, based upon completion of the 
background check, whether the proposed recipient is trustworthy and 
reliable, as required for access to SGI by 10 CFR 73.22(b). If the 
Office of Administration determines that the individual or individuals 
are trustworthy and reliable, the NRC will promptly notify the 
requestor in writing. The notification will provide the names of 
approved individuals as well as the conditions under which the SGI will 
be provided. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, the 
signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or Protective Order 
\6\ by each individual who will be granted access to SGI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non- Disclosure 
Agreement or Affidavit for SGI must be filed with the presiding 
officer, or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 180 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    H. Release and Storage of SGI. Prior to providing SGI to the 
requestor, the NRC staff will conduct (as necessary) an inspection to 
confirm that the recipient's information protection system is 
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 10 CFR 73.22. Alternatively, 
recipients may opt to view SGI at an approved SGI storage location 
rather than establish their own SGI protection program to meet SGI 
protection requirements.
    I. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI and/or SGI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 
days after receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more 
than 25 days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) 
the information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of opportunity for hearing), the petitioner 
may file its SUNSI and/or SGI contentions by that later deadline.
    J. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI and/or SGI is denied by the 
NRC staff either after a determination on standing and requisite need, 
or after a determination on trustworthiness and reliability, the NRC 
staff shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly 
stating the reason or reasons for the denial.

[[Page 64492]]

    (2) Before the Office of Administration makes a final adverse 
determination regarding the trustworthiness and reliability of the 
proposed recipient(s) for access to SGI, the Office of Administration, 
in accordance with 10 CFR 2.336(f)(1)(iii), must provide the proposed 
recipient(s) any records that were considered in the trustworthiness 
and reliability determination, including those required to be provided 
under 10 CFR 73.57(e)(1), so that the proposed recipient(s) have an 
opportunity to correct or explain the record.
    (3) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination regarding access to SUNSI or with respect to standing or 
need to know for SGI by filing a challenge within 5 days of receipt of 
that determination with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    (4) The requestor may challenge the Office of Administration's 
final adverse determination with respect to trustworthiness and 
reliability for access to SGI by filing a request for review in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.336(f)(1)(iv).
    (5) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    K. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest independent of the proceeding. 
Such a challenge must be filed within 5 days of the notification by the 
NRC staff of its grant of access and must be filed with: (a) the 
presiding officer designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another administrative judge or an 
Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); 
or (c) if another officer has been designated to rule on information 
access issues, with that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or denying access) is governed by 10 
CFR 2.311.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562, August 3, 2012) apply to appeals of NRC staff 
determinations (because they must be served on a presiding officer 
or the Commission, as applicable), but not to the initial SUNSI and/
or SGI request submitted to the NRC staff under these procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    L. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests 
for access to SUNSI and/or SGI, and motions for protective orders, in a 
timely fashion in order to minimize any unnecessary delays in 
identifying those petitioners who have standing and who have propounded 
contentions meeting the specificity and basis requirements in 10 CFR 
part 2. The attachment to this Order summarizes the general target 
schedule for processing and resolving requests under these procedures.
    It is so ordered.

    Dated: August 1, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

                            determination whether the request for access
                            provides a reasonable basis to believe
                            standing can be established and shows (1)
                            need for SUNSI and/or (2) need to know SGI.
                            (For SUNSI, NRC staff also informs any party

                            release of the information.) If NRC staff
                            makes the finding of need for SUNSI and
                            likelihood of standing, NRC staff begins

II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses and Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination

    For the facility-specific amendment requests shown in this notice, 
the Commission finds that the licensees' analyses provided, consistent 
with section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) ``Notice for public comment; State consultation,'' are sufficient 
to support the proposed determinations that these amendment requests 
involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, 
operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments 
would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves NSHC. In addition, the Commission may issue any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period 
if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that 
failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or 
shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice 
of issuance. If the Commission makes a final NSHC determination for any 
of these amendments, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take action on any amendment before 
60 days have elapsed will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59

[[Page 63991]]

p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing 
system time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an email 
confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing system also 
distributes an email that provides access to the document to the NRC's 
Office of the General Counsel and any others who have advised the 
Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in the 
proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    The following table provides the plant name, docket number, date of 
application, ADAMS accession number, and location in the application of 
the licensees' proposed NSHC determinations. For further details with 
respect to these license amendment applications, see the applications 
for amendment, which are available for public inspection in ADAMS. For 
additional direction on accessing information related to this document,

III. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Combined Licenses

    During the period since publication of the last monthly notice, the 
Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has 
determined for each of these amendments that the application complies 
with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The 
Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.

[[Page 63994]]

    A notice of consideration of issuance of amendment to facility 
operating license or combined license, as applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing in connection with these 
actions, were published in the Federal Register as indicated in the 
safety evaluation for each amendment.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that 
these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.22(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to each action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession numbers for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2023-0113]


NUREG: Environmental Evaluation of Accident Tolerant Fuels With 
Increased Enrichment and Higher Burnup Levels

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Final report; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing NUREG-
2266, ``Environmental Evaluation of Accident Tolerant Fuels with 
Increased Enrichment and Higher Burnup Levels.'' This study evaluates 
the reasonably foreseeable impacts of near-term accident tolerant fuel 
(ATF) technologies with increased enrichment and higher burnup levels 
for light-water reactors (LWRs) (i.e., a bounding analysis). The final 
NUREG was revised based on public comments to reflect a bounding 
analysis of up to 10 wt% U-235 enrichment for the uranium fuel cycle 
and decommissioning to, among other things, add transportation impacts 
for half-batch reloads, and to provide clarification on the use of 
NUREG-2266 if exceeding 10 wt% U-235 for uranium fuel cycle and 
decommissioning, exceeding 8 wt% U-235 enrichment for the 
transportation of fuel and waste, or exceeding assembly averaged burnup 
levels of 80 GWd/MTU.

DATES: NUREG-2266 is available on August 6, 2024.

ADDRESSES: Please refer to Docket ID NRC-2023-0113 when contacting the 
NRC about the availability of information regarding this document. You

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    To support efficient and effective licensing reviews of new ATFs 
and to reduce the need for a complex site-specific environmental review 
for each ATF license amendment request, this study evaluated the likely 
impacts of near-term ATF technologies with increased enrichment and 
higher burnup levels on the uranium fuel cycle, transportation of fuel 
and waste, and decommissioning for LWRs (i.e., a bounding analysis). 
Near-term first-generation ATF technologies are coated cladding and 
doped pellets; a second-generation ATF technology is iron-chrome-
aluminum (FeCrAl) cladding. Long-term ATF technologies are not a part 
of this study. The NRC staff evaluated the impact of increased 
enrichment and higher burnup levels by assessing and applying NRC-
sponsored ATF technology reports, prior environmental reviews, 
transportation studies, and new or updated data sources to determine 
the bounding (generic) environmental impacts of deploying ATF 
technologies with increased enrichment and higher burnup levels in 
LWRs.
    Based on findings in this study, the NRC staff concludes, with 
regard to near-term first- or second-generation ATF technologies (i.e., 
coated cladding, doping, and FeCrAl cladding), the environmental 
effects associated with deploying and using ATF would be bounded by the 
NRC staff's prior analyses. With regard to the uranium fuel cycle and 
decommissioning, Table S-3, paragraph 51.51(b) of title 10 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), NUREG-2157, ``Generic Environmental 
Impact Statement for Continued Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel,'' and 
NUREG-0586, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement on Decommissioning 
of Nuclear Facilities, Supplement 1'' bound enrichments up to 10 wt% U-
235 enrichment and assembly averaged burnup up to 80 GWd/MTU. For the 
transportation of ATF with increased enrichment and higher burnup 
levels, environmental impacts of Table S-4 of 10 CFR 51.52(c) are 
bounding for environmental impacts up to 8 wt% U-235 and assembly 
averaged burnup up to 80 GWd/MTU. Additionally, if in a future 
licensing action where the enrichment and burnup levels are greater 
than the previously mentioned values, an applicant can apply the 
methodology and guidance of NUREG-2266 for completing the needed 
revised analysis for the higher enrichment and burnup levels.
    The NRC staff continues to prepare to review license applications 
related to ATF technologies and fuel with increased enrichment and 
higher burnup levels. Once such licensing applications are submitted 
after the final publication of NUREG-2266, the NRC staff will, as 
appropriate, evaluate new industry developments and other subsequent 
ATF activities using this NUREG as the environmental baseline for 
considering further refinements of the ATF environmental evaluation 
that those licensing actions may require.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC published a notice in the Federal Register on September 1, 
2023, (88 FR 60507) requesting public comment on draft NUREG-2266, 
``Environmental Evaluation of Accident Tolerant Fuels with Increased 
Enrichment and Higher Burnup Levels.''

[[Page 63989]]

The comment period closed on October 31, 2023. Two members of the 
public and two organizations provided comments on the draft NUREG-2266. 
Appendix F of the final NUREG-2266 presents the comments received on 
the draft NUREG-2266, with responses to the comments and indicates 
whether and where the final NUREG-2266 was revised as a result of a 
comment. Other text revisions were made for additional clarity. All 
changes based on public comments are noted with an associated margin 
mark.

III. Congressional Review Act

    This NUREG-2266, ``Environmental Evaluation of Accident Tolerant 
Fuels with Increased Enrichment and Higher Burnup Levels,'' is a rule 
as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808). However, 
the Office of Management and Budget has not found it to be a major rule 
as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    The NRC's issuance and use of this report does not constitute 
backfitting as that term is defined in 10 CFR 50.109, 70.76, and 72.62, 
``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC Management Directive (MD) 8.4, 
``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and 
Information Requests''; does not affect the issue finality of an 
approval under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and 
Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants'' and does not constitute forward 
fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 8.4.

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a proposed collection of 
information to OMB for review entitled ``Planned Power Uprate-Related 
Licensing Submittals for All Power Reactor Licensees.'' The NRC hereby 
informs potential respondents that an agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and that a person is not required to respond to, a collection 
of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on April 29, 2024, 89 FR 33402.
    1. The title of the information collection: Planned Power Uprate-
Related Licensing Submittals for All Power Reactor Licensees.
    2. OMB approval number: An OMB control number has not yet been 
assigned to this proposed information collection.
    3. Type of submission: New.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Annually, 
with the addition of voluntary updates as available.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: All holders of 
operating licenses or combined licenses for nuclear power reactors, 
except those that have permanently ceased operations and have certified 
that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel or 
combined license holders that have not received authorization to load 
nuclear fuel and begin operation.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 5.33.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 5.33.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 107.
    10. Abstract: This voluntary information collection assists the NRC 
in determining resource and budget needs as well as aligning the proper 
allocation and utilization of resources to support power uprate related 
licensing activities. In addition, information provided to the NRC 
staff is intended to promote early communications between the NRC and 
the respective addressees about potential power uprate licensing 
actions, submission dates, and related activities to support power 
uprates, such as alternate source term amendments or accident tolerant 
fuels amendment activities. The overarching goal of this information 
collection is to assist the NRC staff more effectively and efficiently 
plan, schedule, and implement activities and reviews in a timely 
manner.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated April 17, 2024 (ADAMS Package Accession No. 
ML24108A007), CEG submitted to the NRC an application for SLR of 
Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-19 and DPR-25 for Dresden, 
Units 2 and 3, for an additional 20 years of operation. This submission 
initiated the NRC's proposed action of determining whether to grant the 
SLR application. Dresden is located in Morris IL, approximately 23 
miles southwest of Joliet, IL. The current facility operating license 
for Dresden, Unit 2, expires at midnight on December 22, 2029, and the 
current facility operating license for Dresden, Unit 3 expires at 
midnight on January 12, 2031. The SLR application was submitted 
pursuant to part 54 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR), ``Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear 
Power Plants,'' and seeks to extend the facility operating license for 
Unit 2 to midnight on December 22, 2049, and Unit 3 to midnight January 
12, 2051. A notice of receipt and availability of the application was 
published in the Federal Register on May 7, 2024 (89 FR 38197). A 
notice of acceptance for docketing of the application and of 
opportunity to request a hearing was published in the Federal Register 
on June 24, 2024 (89 FR 52514) and is available on the Federal 
rulemaking website (https://www.regulations.gov) by searching for 
Docket ID NRC-2024-0080.

III. Request for Comment

    This notice informs the public of the NRC staff's intent to conduct 
environmental scoping and prepare an EIS related to the SLR application 
for Dresden, and to provide the public an opportunity to participate in 
the environmental scoping process, as defined in 10 CFR 51.29 
``Scoping-environmental impact statement and supplement to 
environmental impact statement,'' and 10 CFR 51.116, ``Notice of 
intent.''
    The regulations in 36 CFR 800.8, ``Coordination with the National 
Environmental Policy Act,'' allow agencies to use their National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) 
(NEPA), process to fulfill the requirements of Section 106 of the 
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 U.S.C. 300101, et seq.) 
(NHPA).
    Therefore, pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8(c), the NRC staff intends to 
use its process and documentation required for the preparation of the 
EIS on the proposed action to comply with Section 106 of the NHPA in 
lieu of the procedures set forth at 36 CFR 800.3 through 800.6.
    In accordance with the regulations in 10 CFR part 51 and the 
Commission's decision in CLI-22-2 (ADAMS Accession No. ML22055A496), 
Dresden submitted an environmental report (ER) as part of the SLR 
application. The ER is available in ADAMS under Accession No. 
ML24108A011. The ER is also available for viewing at: https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications/Dresden-subsequent.html.
    As part of its environmental review, the NRC staff will first 
conduct a scoping process for the EIS and, as soon as practicable 
thereafter, will prepare a draft EIS for public comment. Participation 
in this scoping process by members of the public and local, State, 
Tribal, and Federal government agencies is encouraged. The scoping 
process for the EIS will be used to accomplish the following:
    a. Define the proposed action that is to be the subject of the EIS;
    b. Determine the scope of the EIS and identify the significant 
issues to be analyzed in depth;
    c. Identify and eliminate from detailed study those issues that are 
peripheral or are not significant or that have been covered by prior 
environmental review;
    d. Identify any environmental assessments and other ElSs that are 
being or will be prepared that are related to, but are not part of, the 
scope of the EIS under consideration;

[[Page 63452]]

    e. Identify other environmental review and consultation 
requirements related to the proposed action;
    f. Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation 
of the environmental analyses and the NRC's tentative planning and 
decision-making schedule;
    g. Identify any cooperating agencies and, as appropriate, allocate 
assignments for preparation and schedules for completing the EIS to the 
NRC and any cooperating agencies; and
    h. Describe how the EIS will be prepared, including any contractor 
assistance to be used.
    The NRC staff invites the following entities to participate in 
scoping:
    a. The applicant, CEG, LLC;
    b. Any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or that is 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    c. Affected State and local government agencies, including those 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    d. Any affected Native American Tribe;
    e. Any person who requests or has requested an opportunity to 
participate in the scoping process; and
    f. Any person who has petitioned or who intends to petition, for 
leave to intervene in the proceeding under 10 CFR 2.309.

IV. Public Scoping Meeting

    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.26(b), the scoping process for an EIS 
may include a public scoping meeting to help identify significant 
issues related to the proposed action and to determine the scope of 
issues to be addressed in the EIS.
    The NRC is announcing that it will hold two public scoping meetings 
as online webinars for the Dresden SLR application. Both webinars will 
include telephone lines for members of the public to provide comments. 
A court reporter will transcribe all comments received during the 
webinars. To be considered, comments must be provided either at the 
transcribed public meeting or in writing, as discussed in the ADDRESSES 
section of this document. The public scoping meetings will be held as 
online webinars on August 20, 2024, from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. CT and from 
5 p.m. to 7 p.m. CT. Persons interested in attending these online 
webinars should monitor the NRC's Public Meeting Schedule website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg for additional information, agendas for 
the meeting, and access information for the webinar. Please contact Tam 
Tran no later than August 9, 2024, if accommodations or special 
equipment is needed to attend or to provide comments, so that the NRC 
staff can determine whether the request can be accommodated.
    Both public scoping meetings will include: (1) an overview by the 
NRC staff of the environmental and safety review processes, the 
proposed scope of the EIS, and the proposed review schedule; and (2) 
the opportunity for interested government agencies, organizations, and 
individuals to submit comments or suggestions on environmental issues 
or the proposed scope of the Dresden SLR EIS.
    Participation in the scoping process for the Dresden SLR EIS does 
not entitle participants to become parties to the proceeding to which 
the EIS relates. Matters related to participation in any hearing are 
outside the scope of matters to be discussed at this public meeting.

    Dated: July 31, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    On June 21, 2023, the NRC issued a Federal Register notice (88 FR 
40337) soliciting public comment on its draft ISG, ``Use of the 
Decommissioning Trust Fund During Operations for Major Radioactive 
Component Disposal.'' The NRC received comments from Lili Lamar Shari 
Laskowitz, by letter dated August 20, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23236A525), Paul Saunders, by letter dated June 29, 2023 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML23181A049), Lili Lamar Zucker Ashley Humphries, by 
letter dated August 20, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23236A527), John J. 
Sipos, by letter dated September 13, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23262B451), the Appalachian Compact Commission, by letter dated July 
28, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23236A522), the Nuclear Energy 
Institute, by letter dated August 21, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23236A529), EnergySolutions, by letter dated August 21, 2023 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML23236A528) and from Constellation Energy Generation, 
LLC, by letter dated August 21, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23236A531). 
No other comments were submitted. The NRC staff considered those 
comments in developing the final version of the ISG. The staff's 
responses to the comments are provided in Appendix A, ``Disposition of 
Public Comments,'' of the final ISG.
    This ISG is intended to provide clarifying guidance to facilitate 
stakeholder understanding of the NRC's position on the use of the DTF 
during operations for MRC disposal. The NRC's reactor licensing 
regulations in part 50 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization

[[Page 63448]]

Facilities,'' establish requirements for providing assurance that 
funding will be available to radiologically decommission a reactor 
facility and terminate the part 50 license. Specifically, these 
requirements address, among other things, the amount of decommissioning 
funding to be provided, the methods to be used for assuring sufficient 
funding, and provisions restricting the use of the DTF during 
operations.
    Two separate petitions for rulemaking (PRM) were submitted to the 
NRC for consideration in 2008 and 2019 requesting that the NRC revise 
the definition of Decommissioning in 10 CFR 50.2 and amend 10 CFR 50.82 
to allow access to the DTF to pay for the cost of the disposal of MRCs 
prior to permanent cessation of operations at nuclear power plants. The 
Commission denied both petitions, noting the subject is adequately 
covered by existing regulations, including the exemption process in 10 
CFR 50.12, ``Specific exemptions.'' In the analyses recommending denial 
of the PRMs, the NRC staff noted that any withdrawal of funds from the 
DTF during operations, other than those allowed by NRC regulations, 
could undermine the intent of the decommissioning funding regulations. 
Therefore, only under extraordinary circumstances would a withdrawal 
from the DTF prior to permanent cessation of operations be permissible.
    The NRC staff evaluates each exemption request for a DTF withdrawal 
to ensure it meets the criteria for special exemptions in 10 CFR 50.12 
and considers the totality of facts in determining whether to grant or 
deny a request. This ISG discusses the mechanisms which allow the use 
of a DTF to cover the cost of MRC disposal during operations. 
Information a licensee may provide that assists the NRC staff in 
assessing a licensee's exemption request from the regulations related 
to the use of a DFT is also presented.

II. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of this ISG will not (i) constitute backfitting as defined 
in section 50.109 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR), ``Backfitting,'' and as described in Management Directive (MD) 
8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and 
Information Requests''; (ii) affect issue finality of any approval 
issued under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals 
for Nuclear Power Plants''; or (iii) constitute forward fitting as that 
term is defined and described in MD 8.4. This ISG states the NRC 
staff's position on the use of decommissioning trust funds during 
operations for disposal and lists examples of factors that the NRC 
staff would consider when evaluating exemption requests under 10 CFR 
50.12. Applicants and licensees will not be required to comply with the 
positions set forth in this ISG.

III. Congressional Review Act

    This ISG is not a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act 
(5 U.S.C. 801-808).

    Dated: July 30, 2024.

II. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility 
Operating License No. DPR-59, issued to Constellation Energy 
Generation, LLC, for operation of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear 
Power Plant, located in Scriba, New York. The proposed amendment would 
revise the technical specifications based on the updated fuel handling 
accident analysis.
    Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the NRC will 
need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and NRC's regulations.
    The NRC has made a proposed determination that the license 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under 
the NRC's regulations in section 50.92 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Issuance of amendment,'' this means 
that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed 
amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction 
in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has 
provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards 
consideration, which is presented as follows:
    1. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

[[Page 63227]]

    Response: No.
    The proposed amendment does not change any behavior or operation of 
the Fuel Handling Equipment due to transition from Refuel Bridge Mast 
NF-400 to NF-500 and time definition for Recently Irradiated Fuel.
    The proposed change results in an increase in the Fuel Handling 
Accident (FHA) analysis radiological dose to a Control Room occupant. 
However, the resultant FHA Control Room dose consequences remain within 
the acceptance criteria provided by the NRC for use with the 
Alternative Source Term. These criteria are presented in 10 CFR 50.67 
and Regulatory Guide 1.183. Therefore, the proposed change does not 
involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated.
    The proposed amendment does not result in a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident.
    2. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The NF-500 mast is similar enough in design and function to the NF-
400 mast to not create the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident. The proposed change does not significantly alter the Fuel 
Handling system design, create new failure modes, or change any modes 
of operation. Consequently, there are no new initiators that could 
result in a new or different kind of accident.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a 
new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
    3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety?
    Response: No.
    The change preserves the original design requirements and ensures 
adequate validation to confirm continued design capability. The margin 
of safety is considered to be that provided by meeting the applicable 
regulatory limits. The change to the FHA modeling results in an 
increase in Control Room dose following the FHA; however, since the 
Control Room dose following the design basis accident remains within 
the regulatory limits, there is not a significant reduction in a margin 
of safety.
    Based on the above, Constellation concludes that the proposed 
change to the Fuel Handling Accident analysis does not involve a 
significant hazards consideration under the standards set forth in 10 
CFR 50.92(c), and accordingly, a finding of no significant hazards 
consideration is justified.
    The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on 
this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration.
    The NRC is seeking public comments on this proposed determination 
that the license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination. The licensee's supplement dated July 29, 2024, requested 
that the amendment be processed under exigent circumstances, in 
accordance with the provisions in 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6). Processing an 
amendment under exigent circumstances allows a reduced period for 
public comment on the proposed no significant hazards consideration 
determination, other than the normal 30-day comment period. However, 
the NRC staff has determined that exigent circumstances does not apply 
to this amendment. As such, the amendment is not being processed as an 
exigent amendment.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue an amendment until 60 days 
after the date of publication of the notice providing an opportunity 
for hearing. However, the Commission may issue the license amendment 
before expiration of the 60-day notice period if the Commission 
concludes the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. 
In addition, the Commission may issue the amendment prior to the 
expiration of the 30-day comment period if circumstances change during 
the 30-day comment period such that failure to act in a timely way 
would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility. A 
final no significant hazards consideration determination, if made, will 
consider all public and State comments received. If the Commission 
takes action prior to the expiration of either the comment period or 
the notice period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of 
issuance. If the Commission makes a final no significant hazards 
consideration determination, any hearing will take place after 
issuance.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).

[[Page 63228]]

    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 10 
CFR part 26, ``Fitness for Duty Programs.'' The NRC hereby informs 
potential respondents that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and 
that a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on May 7, 2024, 89 FR 38195.
    1. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR part 26, 
``Fitness for Duty Programs.''
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0146.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: NRC Form 890, ``Single Positive 
Test Form,'' NRC Form 891, ``Annual Reporting Form for Drug and Alcohol 
Tests,'' and NRC Form 892, ``Annual Fatigue Reporting Form.''
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Annually and 
on occasion. The NRC receives reports on an annual basis that detail 
fitness-for-duty (FFD) program performance. The NRC also receives, on 
occasion, reports associated with FFD policy violations or programmatic 
failures. Depending on the type of violation or programmatic failure, 
the report would be made within 24 hours of the event occurrence, or 
within 30 days of completing an investigation into a programmatic 
failure.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Nuclear power reactor 
licensees licensed under 10 CFR part 50, ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities'' and 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants'' (except those 
who have permanently ceased operations and have verified that fuel has 
been permanently removed from the reactor); all holders of nuclear 
power plant construction permits and early site permits with a limited 
work authorization and applicants for nuclear power plant construction 
permits that have a limited work authorization under the provisions of 
10 CFR part 50; all holders of a combined license for a nuclear power 
plant issued under 10 CFR part 52 and applicants for a combined license 
that have a limited work authorization; all licensees who are 
authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of 
strategic special nuclear material (SSNM) under the provisions of 10 
CFR part 70, ``Domestic Licensing of Special Nuclear Material;'' all 
holders of a certificate of compliance of an approved compliance plan 
issued under 10 CFR part 76 ``Certification of Gaseous Diffusion 
Plants,'' if the holder engages in

[[Page 62806]]

activities involving formula quantities of SSNM; and all contractor/
vendors (C/Vs) who implement FFD programs or program elements to the 
extent that the licensees and other entities listed in this paragraph 
rely on those C/V FFD programs or program elements to comply with 10 
CFR part 26.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 324,646 responses (254 
reporting responses + 49 recordkeepers + 324,343 third-party disclosure 
responses).
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 64,392 respondents 
(28 drug and alcohol testing programs + 21 fatigue management programs 
+ 64,343 third party respondents).
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 540,050 (5,301 hours 
reporting + 169,746 hours recordkeeping + 365,003 hours third-party 
disclosure).
    10. Abstract: The NRC regulations in 10 CFR part 26 prescribe 
requirements to establish, implement, and maintain FFD programs at 
affected licensees and other entities. The objectives of these 
requirements are to provide reasonable assurance that persons subject 
to the rule are trustworthy, reliable, and not under the influence of 
any substance, legal or illegal, or mentally or physically impaired 
from any cause, which in any way could adversely affect their ability 
to safely and competently perform their duties. These requirements also 
provide reasonable assurance that the effects of fatigue and degraded 
alertness on individual's abilities to safely and competently perform 
their duties are managed commensurate with maintaining public health 
and safety. The information collections required by 10 CFR part 26 are 
necessary to properly manage FFD programs and to enable effective and 
efficient regulatory oversight of affected licensees and other 
entities. These licensees and other entities must perform certain 
tasks, maintain records, and submit reports to comply with 10 CFR part 
26 drug and alcohol and fatigue management requirements. These records 
and reports are necessary to enable regulatory inspection and 
evaluation of a licensee's or other entity's compliance with NRC 
regulations, FFD performance, and significant FFD-related events to 
help maintain public health and safety, promote the common defense and 
security, and protect the environment.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Docket No. 50-400

Duke Energy Progress, LLC

Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1

Exemption

I. Background

    Duke Energy Progress, LLC (Duke Energy, the licensee) is the holder 
of Renewed Facility Operating License No. NPF-63, which authorizes 
operation of Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (Harris). The 
license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to 
all rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC) now or hereafter in effect. The facility consists of a 
pressurized-water reactor located in Wake and Chatham Counties, North 
Carolina.

II. Request/Action

    By application dated February 6, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access 
and Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML24037A284), as 
supplemented by letters dated April 3, 2024 (ML24094A105), and June 7, 
2024 (ML24159A746), Duke Energy, pursuant to Title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) Section 50.12, ``Specific exemptions,'' 
requested an exemption from a provision in the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard (std) 279-1971, ``Criteria 
for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,'' that is 
required by CFR 50.55a(h)(2), ``Protection systems,'' for Harris. 
Specifically, the exemption request would remove the requirement for 
the Harris reactor protection system (RPS) cables that terminate within 
turbine control system (TCS) Cabinet G (1TCS-CAB-G) to be independent 
and physically separated in accordance with IEEE 279-1971, Section 4.6, 
``Channel Independence.'' The licensee stated that application of the 
regulation in this circumstance would not serve the underlying purpose 
of the rule and is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of 
the rule. The exemption request was submitted for review under the 
NRC's Risk-Informed Process for Evaluations (RIPE).

III. Discussion

    The regulations in 10 CFR 50.55a(h)(2) state:

    For nuclear power plants with construction permits issued after 
January 1, 1971, but before May 13, 1999, protection systems must 
meet the requirements in IEEE Std 279-1968, ``Proposed IEEE Criteria 
for Nuclear Power Plant Protection Systems,'' or the requirements in 
IEEE Std 279-1971, ``Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear 
Power Generating Stations,'' or the requirements in IEEE Std 603-
1991, ``Criteria for Safety Systems for Nuclear Power Generating 
Stations,'' and the correction sheet dated January 30, 1995. For 
nuclear power plants with construction permits issued before January 
1, 1971, protection systems must be consistent with their licensing 
basis or may meet the requirements of IEEE Std. 603-1991 and the 
correction sheet dated January 30, 1995.

    Duke Energy requested an exemption from IEEE 279-1971, Section 4.6, 
as required by 10 CFR 50.55a(h)(2), for specific RPS cables at Harris. 
Contrary to the requirements in IEEE 279-1971, Section 4.6, the safety-
related RPS cables that terminate within TCS Cabinet G are not 
independent and physically separated from the non-safety-related TCS 
cables. The licensee requested the exemption in order to maintain the 
current configuration of the TCS circuitry at Harris.
    Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the NRC may, upon application by any 
interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from 
requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when: (1) the exemptions are authorized 
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, 
and are consistent with the common defense and security, and (2) 
special circumstances, as defined in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), are present. 
The licensee states that the special circumstances associated with its 
exemption request are that the ``application of the regulation in this 
circumstance would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule and is 
not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.''
    The exemption request was submitted for review under the RIPE, 
which is described in the NRC's ``Guidelines for Characterizing the 
Safety Impact of Issues,'' Revision 2 (referenced henceforth as SIC) 
(ML22088A135). The Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) temporary 
staff guidance (TSG) document TSG-DORL-2021-01, Revision 3 
(ML23122A014), provides the framework and guidance for the staff to 
implement the streamlined processing of exemption requests from NRC 
requirements submitted under RIPE. Use of RIPE for exemption requests 
is limited to issues for which the safety impact can be modeled using 
probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) and shown to have a minimal safety 
impact per SIC. RIPE is based on the application of pre-existing risk-
informed criteria that allows for the staff's review and disposition of 
the submittal to be streamlined and efficient.
    As described in the SIC, all the following must apply in order to 
characterize an issue as having a minimal safety impact and qualify for 
consideration under the RIPE:
     The issue contributes less than 1 x 10-\7\/year 
to core damage frequency (CDF);
     The issue contributes less than 1 x 10-\8\/year 
to large early release frequency (LERF);
     The issue has no safety impact or minimal safety impact in 
accordance with the SIC; and
     Cumulative risk is assessed based on plant-specific CDF 
and LERF. Cumulative risk is acceptable for the purposes of this 
guidance if baseline risk remains less than 1 x 10-\4\/year 
for CDF and less than 1 x 10-\5\/year for LERF once the 
impact of the proposed change is incorporated into baseline risk.
    RIPE exemption requests must also include defense-in-depth (DID) 
and safety margin considerations assessed by the integrated decision-
making panel (IDP).
    Requests for changes made under the RIPE are reviewed by the NRC 
staff in a manner consistent with the principles of risk-informed 
decision-making outlined in Regulatory Guide 1.174, Revision 3, ``An 
Approach for Using Probabilistic Risk Assessment in Risk-Informed 
Decisions on Plant-Specific Changes to the Licensing Basis'' 
(ML17317A256), which includes ensuring that the proposed change is 
consistent with DID philosophy, maintains sufficient safety margins, is 
consistent with the Commission's Safety Goal Policy Statement, and 
includes performance monitoring strategies.

Conformance With the RIPE Minimal Safety Impact Criteria

    The licensee considered the RIPE screening questions contained in 
the SIC and concluded that the requested exemption would not have a 
more than minimal impact on safety. Considerations for each of the five 
screening questions are discussed below.
    1. Does the issue result in an adverse impact on the frequency of 
occurrence of an accident initiator or result in a new accident 
initiator?

[[Page 62808]]

    In Section 4.4 of the exemption request, the licensee states that 
the issue does not result in an adverse impact on the frequency of 
occurrence of an accident initiator or result in a new accident 
initiator because the cables impacted by the issue are associated with 
the solid state protection system (SSPS), which provides the logic to 
develop reactor trip and emergency safety feature actuation signals 
(ESFAS). The licensee also states that the SSPS provides a mitigation 
function and does not initiate an accident or create a new accident 
initiator.
    The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's consideration of this 
screening element and concluded that the issue does not adversely 
impact the frequency of occurrence of an accident initiator or result 
in a new accident initiator because the SSPS provides a mitigation 
function and does not initiate an accident.
    2. Does the issue result in an adverse impact on the availability, 
reliability, or capability of structures, systems, or components (SSCs) 
or personnel relied upon to mitigate a transient, accident, or natural 
hazard?
    In Section 4.4 of the exemption request, the licensee states that 
the issue does not result in an adverse impact on the availability, 
reliability, or capability of SSCs or personnel relied upon to mitigate 
a transient, accident, or natural hazard because the safety-related 
protection trains will remain fully capable of performing their 
intended functions. The licensee's conclusion is based on an evaluation 
that reviewed potential sources of electrical anomalies and the 
mitigation techniques used to reduce the probability of an event 
occurring that could impact plant equipment. The electrical anomaly 
evaluation is described in Section 4.1 of the exemption request and 
included evaluation of the cabinet design, cabinet location, electrical 
grounding, power source design, signal attenuation due to cable length, 
equipment qualification, cable routing, previous testing of low-level 
instrument wiring, plant operating experience, and the requirements in 
IEEE 384-1974, ``IEEE Trial-Use Standard Criteria for Separation of 
Class 1E Equipment and Circuits.'' The evaluation concludes that there 
are no credible electrical anomaly events which could impact either 
train of safety-related equipment from performing its design basis 
function.
    The license stated that the turbine trip logic connects to the SSPS 
and RPS through four control relays that use redundant contacts from 
the reactor trip breaker. In addition, the licensee stated the reactor 
trip breaker auxiliary contacts provide indication of a reactor trip to 
the turbine trip system (TTS) and that an open or short of the contacts 
used for the non-safety related portion of the circuit would not 
prevent a reactor trip from occurring, if required, because the 
auxiliary contacts are not in the direct electrical path of the reactor 
trip breakers. The cables and conduits for each of these circuits 
follow the separation criteria requirements except for Terminal Box B 
and TCS Cabinet G. The isolation between the TCS and the RPS/SSPS 
trains is provided in the RPS and SSPS cabinets.
    In the exemption request, the licensee stated that if a short 
circuit were to occur, the impact would be limited to a single train of 
the TTS and that multiple shorts would be needed to impact both TTS 
trains. In its supplement dated June 7, 2024, the licensee stated:

    A fault of the TTS cables could impact the non-safety-related 
automatic turbine trip on reactor trip function. For example, a 
fault could cause a short circuit which could bypass the SSPS 
turbine trip output relay contacts, thus preventing the turbine from 
tripping. If this were to occur and a reactor trip occurred, 
Operations would trip the turbine manually by the Main Control Board 
turbine trip switch per step 2 of [Harris] Emergency Operating 
Procedure EOP-E-0, ``REACTOR TRIP OR SAFETY INJECTION.''

    Under 10 CFR 50.62(c)(1), each pressurized-water reactor must have 
equipment, from sensor output to final actuation device, that is 
diverse from the reactor trip system, to automatically initiate the 
auxiliary feedwater system and initiate a turbine trip under conditions 
indicative of an anticipated transient without scram (ATWS). Harris 
complied with this requirement by installing ATWS mitigation system 
actuation circuitry (AMSAC). The NRC staff notes that AMSAC would 
remain available to trip the turbine if an ATWS were to occur.
    The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's consideration of this 
screening element and determined that an adverse impact to the 
availability, reliability, or capability of SSCs relied upon to 
mitigate a transient, accident, or natural hazard exists because the 
separation and channel independence requirements of IEEE 279-1971 are 
not met in TCS Cabinet G. However, the licensee's evaluation of the TCS 
circuitry demonstrates that, while the exemption would rely on non-
safety-related equipment to prevent potential electrical anomalies from 
propagating to safety-related components, the TCS design is robust and 
configured such that any electrical perturbations are unlikely. Should 
an electrical short condition result in failure of an automatic turbine 
trip, pre-existing procedurally directed operator actions are available 
to manually initiate the required turbine trip.
    The NRC staff concluded that the adverse impact of not meeting the 
separation and channel independence requirements of IEEE 279-1971, 
Section 4.6, for the RPS cables that terminate within TCS Cabinet G on 
the availability, reliability, or capability of SSCs or personnel 
relied upon to mitigate a transient, accident, or natural hazard is not 
more than minimal because (1) the design of the TCS ensures it is 
unlikely that an electrical anomaly event could occur that would 
prevent either train of safety-related equipment from performing its 
design basis function, (2) not meeting separation and channel 
independence requirements would not impact the reactor trip breakers 
because the turbine trip logic is not directly electrically connected 
the reactor trip breakers, and (3) operator actions and AMSAC would 
remain available to trip the turbine in the unlikely event that a fault 
prevented the turbine trip from occurring automatically.
    3. Does the issue result in an adverse impact on the consequences 
of an accident sequence?
    In Section 4.4 of the exemption request, the licensee stated that 
the issue does not affect the safety-related design functions of the 
SSPS or RPS. The licensee also states the design function of the SSPS 
to mitigate an accident is not impacted and therefore the consequences 
of any accident previously evaluated are not impacted. In its 
supplement dated June 7, 2024, the licensee stated that a fault of the 
TTS cables could impact the non-safety-related automatic turbine trip 
on reactor trip function, but procedurally directed operator actions 
would remain available to manually trip the turbine if needed.
    The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's consideration of this 
screening element and concluded that the proposed exemption does not 
result in an adverse impact on the consequences of an accident because 
the proposed exemption does not prevent the ability of the safety-
related systems to perform their design functions.
    4. Does the issue result in an adverse impact on the capability of 
a fission product barrier?
    In Section 4.4 of the exemption request, the licensee stated that 
the issue does not affect operating limits, the fuel, reactor coolant 
system (RCS), or modify the containment boundary in any way. The cables 
are located outside the containment building and do not result in 
revising or challenging a design

[[Page 62809]]

basis limit for a fission product barrier (i.e., numerical limiting 
value for controlling the integrity of the fuel cladding, reactor 
coolant pressure boundary, and/or containment) as described in the 
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Furthermore, the licensee stated 
the proposed exemption does not prevent the ability of the safety-
related systems to perform their design functions.
    The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's consideration of this 
screening element and concluded that the proposed exemption does not 
result in an adverse impact on the capability of a fission product 
barrier because the proposed exemption does not prevent the ability of 
safety-related systems, including RCS and containment, to perform their 
design functions or alter any design-basis limits.
    5. Does the issue result in an adverse impact on DID capability or 
impact in safety margin?
    In Section 4.4. of the exemption request, the licensee stated that 
there is no adverse impact on DID and safety margins because there are 
no credible events that would prevent both trains of safety-related 
equipment from fulfilling their design-basis functions. The licensee's 
conclusion is based on an evaluation of the potential for electrical 
anomalies described in Section 4.1 of the exemption request, which 
included evaluation of the cabinet design, cabinet location, electrical 
grounding, power source design, signal attenuation due to cable length, 
equipment qualification, cable routing, previous testing of low-level 
instrument wiring, plant operating experience, and the requirements in 
IEEE 384-1974. The evaluation concluded that there are no credible 
electrical anomaly events which could impact either train of safety-
related equipment from performing its design-basis function.
    The licensee stated that, based on the evaluation that established 
there are no credible events that would impact both trains of safety-
related equipment from performing its design-basis function, the key 
aspects of IEEE 279-1971 for single failure criterion and channel 
integrity are maintained. The licensee also stated that while the 
common connection for the ``A'' and ``B'' trains in the TCS does 
challenge the channel independence requirement of IEEE 279-1971, 
Section 4.6, there is not a credible reduction in the ability of the 
safety-related systems to perform their intended design functions. The 
licensee further stated that exemption to the IEEE 279-1971, Section 
4.6, requirement will not impact the ability of the safety-related 
protection trains to remain fully capable of performing their intended 
design functions in generating the signals associated with actuating 
reactor trip and engineered safeguards, as required by IEEE 279-1971.
    In its response to screening question 2, the licensee stated that 
the turbine trip logic connects to the SSPS and RPS through four 
control relays that use redundant contacts from the reactor trip 
breaker and that an open or short of the contacts used for the non-
safety related portion of the circuit would not prevent a reactor trip 
from occurring, if required, because the auxiliary contacts are not in 
the direct electrical path of the reactor trip breakers. The licensee 
also stated that the isolation between the TCS and the RPS/SSPS trains 
is provided in the RPS and SSPS cabinets. Further, the licensee stated 
that if a short circuit were to occur, the impact would be limited to a 
single train and the ability to trip the turbine would not be lost. In 
its supplement dated June 7, 2024, the licensee stated that a fault of 
the TTS cables could impact the non-safety-related automatic turbine 
trip on reactor trip function, but procedurally directed operator 
actions would remain available to manually trip the turbine if needed. 
In addition, the NRC staff notes that AMSAC would remain available to 
trip the turbine if an ATWS were to occur, such as due to multiple 
shorts occurring (which is outside of the single failure proof design 
criteria).
    The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's consideration of this 
screening element and determined that the licensee describes a 
potential adverse impact to DID and safety margins because the channel 
independence requirements of IEEE 279-1971 are not met in TCS Cabinet 
G. However, the licensee's evaluation of the TCS circuitry demonstrates 
that, while the exemption would rely on non-safety-related equipment to 
prevent potential electrical anomalies from propagating to safety-
related components, the TCS design is robust and configured such that 
any electrical perturbations are unlikely. In the unlikely event that 
an electrical condition results in failure of an automatic turbine 
trip, procedurally directed operator actions are available to manually 
trip the turbine. The use of pre-existing procedurally controlled 
operator actions to provide diversity and DID for this unlikely 
scenario does not result in the over-reliance on programmatic measures.
    The NRC staff concluded that the adverse impact of not meeting the 
separation and channel independence requirements of IEEE 279-1971, 
Section 4.6, for the RPS cables that terminate within TCS Cabinet G on 
DID capability and safety margins is not more than minimal because (1) 
the design of the TCS ensures it is unlikely that an electrical anomaly 
event could occur that would prevent either train of safety-related 
equipment from performing its design-basis functions, (2) not meeting 
channel independence requirements would not impact the reactor trip 
breakers because the turbine trip logic is not directly electrically 
connected the reactor trip breakers, and (3) operator actions and AMSAC 
would remain available to trip the turbine in the unlikely event that a 
fault prevented the turbine trip from occurring automatically.

Implementation of an IDP

    The licensee has been approved to adopt 10 CFR 50.69, ``Risk-
informed categorization and treatment of structures, systems and 
components for nuclear power reactors,'' by license amendment No. 174, 
issued September 17, 2019 (ML19192A012), as revised by license 
amendment No. 188, issued January 19, 2022 (ML21316A248). The licensee 
established a multi-disciplinary IDP to evaluate the proposed exemption 
request. The IDP membership included personnel from site engineering, 
operations, PRA, safety analysis, and licensing. Therefore, the NRC 
staff concludes that Harris used an acceptable IDP in support of the 
proposed exemption request per the RIPE guidance in TSG-DORL-2021-01.

Use of an Acceptable/Approved PRA Model

    Harris has adopted risk-informed initiative Technical 
Specifications Task Force (TSTF) traveler TSTF-505, Revision 2, 
``Provide Risk-Informed Extended Completion Times--RITSTF Initiative 
4b,'' for the risk-informed completion time program, as approved by 
license amendment No. 184, issued April 2, 2021 (ML21047A314). The 
Harris PRA model used to support the risk-informed completion time 
license amendment includes internal events, internal flooding, and fire 
hazards. The Harris PRA model does not include high winds, external 
flooding, or seismic hazards due to meeting screening criteria as part 
of the approval of its risk-informed completion time license amendment. 
There are no concerns in this exemption request specifically related to 
high winds, external flooding, or seismic hazards. Implementation of 
the TSTF-505 license amendment and associated license conditions have 
been completed. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that Harris used a 
technically acceptable PRA model in support of the

[[Page 62810]]

proposed exemption request per the RIPE guidance in the SIC.

Evaluation of PRA Results

    The licensee quantitatively assessed the risk significance of 
maintaining the current TCS circuitry at Harris with the proposed 
exemption using a surrogate to represent the potential for a hot short 
to fail the ability of (1) the turbine to trip upon a reactor trip, (2) 
the reactor to trip upon a valid RPS signal, and (3) the ESFAS to 
actuate upon a valid actuation. The surrogate basic event was applied 
in the logic model where turbine trips, RPS signal failures, and ESFAS 
actuations were modeled. The surrogate basic event probability was 
based on the conditional probability of a hot short to occur during a 
conservative selection of fires that impact either train of SSPS. The 
risk results were 1.6 x 10-\8\/year for CDF and less than 1 
x 10-\10\/year for LERF. These results satisfy the RIPE 
criteria of contributing less than 1 x 10-\7\/year to CDF 
and 1 x 10-\8\/year to LERF. Cumulative risk results were 
4.1 x 10-\5\/year for CDF and 3.5 x 10-\6\/year 
for LERF. Therefore, cumulative risk for Harris remains less than the 
RIPE criteria of 1 x 10-\4\/year for CDF and 1 x 
10-\5\/year for LERF. The NRC staff concludes that these 
results satisfy the RIPE criteria for a minimal increase in risk for 
the proposed exemption.

Evaluation of the Need for Risk Management Actions

    Evaluation of the RIPE screening questions and the PRA results 
confirm that the proposed exemption results in a minimal safety impact. 
For these results, the SIC guidance states that risk management actions 
must be considered to offset the risk increase for the NRC staff to 
review under RIPE. Section 4.3 of the exemption request states that a 
review of industry operating experience related to the issue did not 
identify any specific modifications necessary to assess and/or bound 
the impact of the issue on quantitative risk. Therefore, the NRC staff 
concluded that no risk management actions were identified or required.

Assessment of Performance Monitoring Strategies

    Section 4.1 of the exemption request states that the TSC was 
upgraded in 2018 but the cables in question have not been moved since 
original plant construction. Both the previous and current designs 
energize the control circuits continuously so that a loss of power 
would result in a turbine trip. The previous design tested the circuit 
quarterly. The current design cycles the control relays weekly, and 
this test has been performed once a week for over 5 years. There have 
been no instances of spurious control circuit anomalies attributed to 
the TCS trip relays cycling on and off.
    The NRC staff concluded that the existing performance monitoring 
strategies will ensure no deficiencies exist that would challenge the 
conclusions in the licensee's evaluation of the proposed exemption.
A. The Exemption is Authorized by Law
    The NRC has the authority under 10 CFR 50.12 to grant exemptions 
from the requirements of Part 50 upon demonstration of proper 
justification. The licensee has requested an exemption to the 
requirement in 10 CFR 50.55a(h)(2) requiring protection systems meet 
the requirements of IEEE 279-1971, Section 4.6, for safety-related RPS 
cables that terminate within TCS Cabinet G. As discussed below, the NRC 
staff determined that special circumstances exist, which support 
granting the proposed exemption. Furthermore, granting the exemption 
would not result in a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, or the NRC's regulations. Therefore, the exemption is 
authorized by law.
B. The Exemption Presents No Undue Risk to Public Health and Safety
    The NRC staff has concluded that the exemption represents low risk, 
is of minimal safety impact, and that adequate DID and safety margins 
are preserved. The NRC staff concluded that the licensee's submittal 
demonstrates that the design of the TCS is robust against electrical 
failures that would prevent the RPS from performing their intended 
functions with the proposed exemption. Thus, granting this exemption 
request will not pose undue risk to public health and safety.
C. The Exemption Is Consistent With the Common Defense and Security
    The NRC staff has evaluated the licensee's exemption request and 
concluded that the licensee's submittal demonstrates that the design of 
the TCS is robust against electrical failures that would prevent the 
RPS from performing their intended functions with the proposed 
exemption. The NRC staff also concluded that adequate DID and safety 
margins will be preserved with the requested exemption. Further, the 
exemption does not involve security requirements and does not create a 
security risk. Therefore, the exemption is consistent with the common 
defense and security.
D. Special Circumstances
    Special circumstances, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), 
are present whenever application of the regulation in the circumstances 
would not serve the purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve 
the purpose of the rule. The licensee has requested a limited scope 
exemption from 10 CFR 50.55a(h)(2) that would only apply to the RPS 
cables that terminate within TCS Cabinet G. Specifically, the exemption 
request would remove the requirement for the RPS cables that terminate 
within TCS Cabinet G to be independent and physically separated in 
accordance with IEEE 279-1971, Section 4.6. The underlying purpose of 
IEEE 279-1971, Section 4.6, is to ensure the capability of the safety-
related system to accomplish its safety function during normal and 
accident conditions and reduce the likelihood of interactions between 
channels during maintenance operations or in the event of a channel 
malfunction.
    The licensee has supported that the design of the TCS is adequate 
to ensure that the lack of independence and physical separation between 
TCS and RPS cables in TCS Cabinet G is unlikely to prevent either 
system from being able to perform their intended functions. In 
addition, the licensee has also demonstrated that adequate DID and 
safety margins will be preserved with the requested exemption. For 
these reasons, the NRC staff finds that for this limited scope 
exemption to the requirements of 10 CFR 50.55a(h)(2) for the safety-
related RPS cables that terminate within TCS Cabinet G, application of 
the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to 
achieve the underlying purpose of the rule.
E. Environmental Considerations
    The exemption requested by the licensee includes changes to 
requirements with respect to installation or use of a facility 
component located within the restricted area. The NRC staff determined 
that the exemption meets the eligibility criteria for the categorical 
exclusion set forth in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9) because the granting of this 
exemption involves: (i) no significant hazards consideration, (ii) no 
significant change in the types or a significant increase in the 
amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite, and (iii) no 
significant increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation 
exposure. Therefore, in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22(b), no 
environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared in connection with the

[[Page 62811]]

NRC's consideration of this exemption request. The basis for the NRC 
staff's determination of each of the requirements in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9) 
is discussed below.

Requirements in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(i)

    The NRC staff evaluated the issue of no significant hazards 
consideration using the standards described in 10 CFR 50.92(c), as 
presented below:
    1. Does the proposed exemption involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The design of the TCS is robust against electrical failures that 
would prevent the RPS from performing their intended functions with the 
proposed exemption and does not modify how the plant is operated. The 
proposed exemption does not affect any plant protective boundaries, 
cause a release of fission products to the public, or alter the 
performance of any SSCs important to safety.
    Therefore, the proposed exemption does not result in a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated.
    2. Does the proposed exemption create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The design of the TCS is robust against electrical failures that 
would prevent the RPS from performing their intended functions with the 
proposed exemption and does not modify how the plant is operated. In 
addition, the TTS and RPS provide mitigation functions and do not 
initiate accidents or create a new accident initiators.
    Therefore, the proposed exemption does not create the possibility 
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
    3. Does the proposed exemption involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety?
    Response: No.
    The design of the TCS is robust against electrical failures that 
would prevent the RPS from performing their intended functions with the 
proposed exemption and does not modify how the plant is operated. The 
proposed exemption does not alter any setpoints for protective actions, 
change the initial conditions for any accidents, or alter the 
requirements of any SSCs important to safety.
    Therefore, the proposed exemption does not involve a significant 
reduction in a margin of safety.
    The NRC staff concludes that the proposed exemption presents no 
significant hazards consideration under the standards set forth in 10 
CFR 50.92(c), and, accordingly, a finding of no significant hazards 
consideration is justified (i.e., satisfies the provision of 10 CFR 
51.22(c)(9)(i)).

Requirements in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(ii)

    The design of the TCS is robust against electrical failures that 
would prevent the RPS from performing their intended functions with the 
proposed exemption and does not modify how the plant is operated. The 
proposed exemption does not alter any setpoints for protective actions, 
change the initial conditions for any accidents, or alter the 
requirements of any SSCs important to safety. The proposed exemption 
will not significantly change the types or amounts of effluents that 
may be released offsite. Therefore, the staff finds that the provision 
of 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(ii) is satisfied.

Requirements in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(iii)

    The licensee's request supported that the exemption had either no 
or a minimal safety impact for all accident initiator categories and 
the NRC staff has concluded that the proposed exemption will not result 
in an adverse impact on the frequency of existing accident initiators 
or result in new accident initiators. The proposed exemption will not 
significantly increase individual occupational radiation exposure, or 
significantly increase cumulative public or occupational radiation 
exposure. Therefore, the staff finds that the provision of 10 CFR 
51.22(c)(9)(iii) is satisfied.
    The NRC staff concludes that the proposed exemption meets the 
eligibility criteria for the categorical exclusion set forth in 10 CFR 
51.22(c)(9). Therefore, in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22(b), no 
environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared in connection with the NRC's proposed granting of this 
exemption.

IV. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12, the exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue 
risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common 
defense and security. Also, special circumstances are present. 
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Duke Energy an exemption from 
IEEE 279-1971, Section 4.6, as required by 10 CFR 50.55a(h)(2), for the 
safety-related RPS cables at Harris that terminate within TCS Cabinet 
G.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering amending Renewed Facility Operating License 
Nos. NPF-72 and NPF-77, which authorize Constellation to operate 
Braidwood, Units 1 and 2, located in Will County, Illinois. 
Constellation submitted its license amendment request in accordance 
with section 50.90 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulation (10 
CFR), ``Application for amendment of license, construction permit, or 
early site permit,'' by letter dated June 4, 2024. If approved, the 
license amendments would revise TS SR 3.7.9.2 to allow a temporary 
increase in the allowable UHS average temperature of less than or equal 
to (<=) 102.8 [deg]F (39.3 degrees Celsius ([deg]C)) through September 
30, 2024. In accordance with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC has determined that 
an EA is the appropriate form of environmental review for the requested 
action. Based on the results of the EA that follows, the NRC has 
determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the 
proposed amendments and is issuing a FONSI.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would allow Constellation to operate Braidwood, 
Units 1 and 2, at UHS temperatures up to 102.8 [deg]F (39.3 [deg]C) 
until September 30, 2024. The proposed action is in response to the 
licensee's license amendment request application dated June 4, 2024. 
The proposed action would amend the Braidwood, Units 1 and 2, renewed 
operating licenses TS to allow a temporary increase in the allowable 
average temperature of water withdrawn from the UHS and supplied to the 
plant for cooling from <=102 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C) to <=102.8 [deg]F 
(39.3 [deg]C) through September 30, 2024. Specifically, the proposed 
action would revise TS SR 3.7.9.2, which currently states, ``Verify 
average water temperature of UHS is <=102.8 [deg]F until September 30, 
2023. After September 30, 2023, verify average water temperature of UHS 
is <=102 [deg]F'' to state ``Verify average water temperature of UHS is 
<=102.8 [deg]F until September 30, 2024. After September 30, 2024, 
verify average water temperature of UHS is <=102 [deg]F.'' Under the 
current TS, if the average UHS temperature as measured at the discharge 
of the operating essential service water system pumps is greater than 
102 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C), TS 3.7.9, Required Actions A.1 and A.2, would 
be entered concurrently and would require the licensee to place 
Braidwood in hot standby (Mode 3) within 12 hours and cold shutdown 
(Mode 5) within 36 hours. The proposed action would allow Braidwood to 
continue to operate during times when the UHS indicated average water 
temperature exceeds 102 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C) but is less than or equal 
to 102.8 [deg]F (39.3 [deg]C) through September 30, 2024. The current 
TS's UHS average water temperature limit of 102 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C) 
would remain applicable to all other time periods beyond September 30, 
2024. The proposed action is nearly identical to previously approved 
license amendments that allowed for the average water temperature of 
the UHS to be <=102.8 [deg]F until September 30, 2020, September 30, 
2021, September 30, 2022, and September 30, 2023. The NRC issued EAs 
for the 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, UHS amendments in the Federal 
Register on September 10, 2020 (85 FR 55863), July 7, 2021 (86 FR 
35831), July 20, 2022 (87 FR 43301), and June 16, 2023 (88 FR 39487), 
respectively. The NRC issued the license amendments on September 24, 
2020, July 13, 2021, August 10, 2022, and July 13, 2023, respectively. 
The only difference between the previously approved amendments to TS SR 
3.7.9.2 and the proposed action is that the proposed action would 
replace the year ``2023'' with ``2024.'' It should also be noted that 
during the past 4 years the temperature of the UHS has not exceeded 102 
[deg]F, so no cumulative effects need be considered.

Need for the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would allow Constellation to operate Braidwood, 
Units 1 and 2, during the hot summer months by allowing an UHS 
temperature of <=102.8 [deg]F (39.3 [deg]C) until September 30, 2024. 
The licensee has requested the proposed amendments in connection with 
historical meteorological and atmospheric conditions that have resulted 
in the TS UHS temperature being challenged. These conditions included 
elevated air temperatures, high humidity, and low wind speed. 
Specifically, from July 4, 2020, through July 9, 2020, northern 
Illinois experienced high air temperatures and drought conditions, 
which caused sustained elevated UHS temperatures. In response to these 
conditions in 2020, the licensee submitted license amendment requests 
contained in letter dated July 15, 2020, as supplemented by letter 
dated August 14, 2020. The NRC subsequently granted the licensee's 
request by letter dated September 24, 2020. The NRC approved similar 
requests for subsequent years by letters dated July 13, 2021, August 
10, 2022, and July 13, 2023. Constellation projects that similar 
conditions are likely this year. The proposed action

[[Page 61502]]

would provide the licensee with operational flexibility until September 
30, 2024, so that the plant shutdown criteria specified in the TS are 
not triggered unless UHS temperature exceeds 102.8 [deg]F (39.3 
[deg]C).

Plant Site and Environs

    Braidwood Station, in Will County, Illinois, is located 
approximately 50 miles (mi) or 80 kilometers (km) southwest of the 
Chicago Metropolitan Area and 20 mi (32 km) south-southwest of Joliet. 
The Kankakee River is approximately five mi (8 km) east of the eastern 
site boundary. An onsite 2,540-acre (ac); 1,030-hectare (ha) cooling 
pond provides condenser cooling. Cooling water is withdrawn from the 
pond through the lake screen house, which is located at the north end 
of the pond. Heated water returns to the cooling pond through a 
discharge canal west of the lake screen house intake that is separated 
from the intake by a dike. The pond typically holds 22,300 acre-feet 
(27.5 million cubic meters) of water at any given time. The cooling 
pond includes both ``essential'' and ``non-essential'' areas. The 
essential cooling pond is the portion of the cooling pond that serves 
as the UHS for emergency core cooling, and it consists of a 99 ac (40-
ha) excavated area of the pond directly in front of the lake screen 
house. The essential cooling pond's principal functions are to 
dissipate residual heat after reactor shutdown and to dissipate heat 
after an accident. It is capable of supplying Braidwood's cooling 
system with water for 30 days without additional makeup water. The term 
``UHS'' in this EA refers to the 99-ac (40-ha) essential cooling pond, 
and the term ``cooling pond'' or ``pond'' describes the entire 2,540-ac 
(1,030-ha) area, which includes both the essential and non-essential 
areas.
    The cooling pond is also part of the Mazonia-Braidwood State Fish 
and Wildlife Area, which encompasses the majority of the non-UHS area 
of the cooling pond as well as Illinois Department of Natural Resources 
(IDNR) owned lands adjacent to the Braidwood site to the south and 
southwest of the cooling pond. Constellation and the IDNR have jointly 
managed the cooling pond as part of the Mazonia-Braidwood State Fish 
and Wildlife Area since 1991 pursuant to a long-term lease agreement. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the public has access to the pond for 
fishing, waterfowl hunting, fossil collecting, and other recreational 
activities.
    The cooling pond is also a wastewater treatment works as defined by 
section 301.415 of title 35 of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC 
301.415). Under this definition, the cooling pond is not considered 
waters of the State under Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC 301.440) 
or waters of the United States under the Federal Clean Water Act (40 
CFR 230.3(s)), and so the cooling pond is not subject to State water 
quality standards. In addition, the cooling pond is a managed ecosystem 
where IDNR fish stocking and other human activities primarily influence 
species composition and population dynamics.
    Since the beginning of the lease agreement, the IDNR has stocked 
the cooling pond with a variety of game fish, including largemouth bass 
(Micropterus salmoides), smallmouth bass (M. dolomieu), blue catfish 
(Ictalurus furcatus), striped bass (Morone saxatilis), crappie (Pomoxis 
spp.), walleye (Sander vitreum), and tiger muskellunge (Esox 
masquinongy x lucius). IDNR performs annual surveys to determine which 
fish to stock based on fishermen preferences, fish abundance, different 
species' tolerance to warm waters, predator and prey dynamics, and 
other factors. Because of the warm water temperatures experienced in 
the summer months, introductions of warm water species, such as 
largemouth bass and blue catfish, have been more successful than 
introductions of cool-water species, such as walleye and tiger 
muskellunge. Since annual surveys began in 1980, IDNR has collected 47 
species in the cooling pond. In recent years, bluegill (Lepomis 
macrochirus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), threadfin shad 
(Dorosoma petenense), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) have been among 
the most abundant species in the cooling pond. Gizzard shad (Dorosoma 
cepedianum), one of the most frequently affected species during periods 
of elevated pond temperatures, have decreased in abundance dramatically 
in recent years, while bluegills, which can tolerate high temperatures 
with relatively high survival rates, have noticeably increased in 
relative abundance. IDNR stocked warm water game species, such as 
largemouth bass and blue catfish, continue to persist in small numbers, 
while cooler water stocked species, such as walleye and tiger 
muskellunge, no longer appear in IDNR survey collections. No Federally 
listed species or designated critical habitats protected under the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA) occur within or near the cooling pond.
    The Kankakee River serves as the source of makeup water for the 
cooling pond. The river also receives continuous blowdown from the 
cooling pond. Water is withdrawn from a small river screen house 
located on the Kankakee River, and liquid effluents from Braidwood are 
discharged into the cooling pond blowdown line, which subsequently 
discharges into the Kankakee River.
    The plant site and environs are described in greater detail in 
Chapter 3 of the NRC's November 2015 ``Generic Environmental Impact 
Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants: Regarding Braidwood 
Station, Units 1 and 2, Final Report'' (NUREG 1437, Supplement 55) or 
``Braidwood FSEIS'' (Final Supplemental Environment Impact Statement). 
Figure 3-5 on pages 3-7 in the Braidwood FSEIS depicts the Braidwood 
Station layout, and Figure 3-4 on pages 3-6 depicts the cooling pond, 
including the portion of the pond that constitutes the essential 
cooling pond (or UHS) and the blowdown line to the Kankakee River.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action consists of changing the year ``2023'' to 
``2024'' in TS SR 3.7.9.2, allowing a temporary increase in the 
allowable UHS average temperature of <=102.8 [deg]F (39.3 [deg]C) until 
September 30, 2024.
    The proposed changes would not increase the probability or 
consequences of radiological accidents. There would be no change to the 
types or amounts of radioactive effluents released into the environment 
and, therefore, no change in occupational or public radiation exposure 
from the proposed changes. Therefore, there would be no significant 
radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
    In addition, the proposed action would have no direct impacts on 
land use or terrestrial biota, as the proposed action involves no new 
construction or modification of plant operational systems. There would 
be no changes to the quality or quantity of nonradiological effluents 
and no changes to the plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination 
System permits would be needed. Overall staffing levels would not 
increase; therefore, worker vehicle air emissions are not expected to 
increase. In addition, there would be no noticeable effect on 
socioeconomic conditions in the region, no environment justice impacts, 
and no impacts to historic and cultural resources from the proposed 
action.
    Temporarily raising the maximum allowable UHS temperature could 
increase cooling pond water temperatures until September 30, 2024. 
Because the proposed action would not affect Braidwood's licensed 
thermal

[[Page 61503]]

power level, the temperature rise across the condensers as cooling 
water travels through the cooling system would remain unchanged. Thus, 
if water in the UHS were to rise to 102.8 [deg]F (39.3 [deg]C), heated 
water returning to the cooling pond through the discharge canal, which 
lies west of the river screen house, could also experience a 
corresponding increase. The additional heat load is expected to 
dissipate across some thermal gradient as discharged water travels down 
the discharge canal and through the 99-ac (40-ha) UHS.
    Fish kills often occur when cooling pond temperatures rise above 95 
[deg]F (35 [deg]C), the temperature at which most fish in the cooling 
pond are thermally stressed. For example, section 3.7.4 of the 
Braidwood FSEIS describes six fish kill events for the period of 2001 
through 2015. The fish kill events, which occurred in July 2001, August 
2001, June 2005, August 2007, June 2009, and July 2012, primarily 
affected threadfin shad and gizzard shad, although bass, catfish, carp, 
and other game fish were also affected. Reported peak temperatures in 
the cooling pond during these events ranged from 98.4 [deg]F (36.9 
[deg]C) to over 100 [deg]F (37.8 [deg]C), and each event resulted in 
the death of between 700 to as many as 10,000 fish. During the July 
2012 event, cooling pond temperatures exceeded 100 [deg]F (37.8 
[deg]C), which resulted in the death of approximately 3,000 gizzard 
shad and 100 bass, catfish, and carp. This event coincided with the 
NRC's granting of Enforcement Discretion to allow Braidwood to continue 
to operate above the TS limit of <=100 [deg]F (37.8 [deg]C). The IDNR 
attributed this event, as well as four of the other fish kill events, 
to Braidwood operation and high cooling pond temperatures. Appendix B, 
section 4.1, of the Braidwood renewed facility operating licenses, 
requires Constellation to report unusual or important environmental 
events, including fish kills, related to plant operation to the NRC. 
Since November 2015 (issuance of the Braidwood FSEIS), Constellation 
has not reported any additional fish kill events to the NRC. Although 
not related to plant operation, several fish kills have occurred since 
this time, the most recent of which happened in August 2018 and July 
2020.
    In section 4.7.1.3 of the Braidwood FSEIS, NRC staff concluded that 
thermal impacts associated with continued operation of Braidwood during 
the license renewal term would result in SMALL to MODERATE impacts to 
aquatic resources in the cooling pond. MODERATE impacts would primarily 
be experienced by gizzard shad and other non-stocked and low-heat 
tolerant species. As part of its conclusion, NRC staff also noted that 
because the cooling pond is a highly managed system, any cascading 
effects that result from the loss of gizzard shad (such as reduction in 
prey for stocked species, which in turn could affect those stocked 
species' populations) could be mitigated through IDNR's annual stocking 
and continual management of the pond. At that time, the UHS TS limit 
was <=100 [deg]F (37.8 [deg]C).
    In 2016, the NRC granted license amendments that increased the 
allowable UHS average water temperature TS limit from <=100 [deg]F 
(37.8 [deg]C) to <=102.0 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C). The NRC staff concluded 
in its environmental review that increasing the TS limit to <=102.0 
[deg]F (38.9 [deg]C) would have no significant environmental effect, 
and the NRC issued a FONSI with the EA.
    In 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 the NRC granted additional license 
amendments that temporarily increased the allowable UHS average water 
temperature TS limit from <=102.0 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C) to <=102.8 
[deg]F (39.3 [deg]C) until September 30, 2020, September 30, 2021, 
September 30, 2022, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The NRC staff 
concluded in their reviews that temporarily increasing the TS limit to 
<=102.8 [deg]F (39.3 [deg]C) would have no significant environmental 
effect, and the NRC issued FONSIs with the EAs.
    The NRC staff has also determined that this proposed action would 
result in no significant impact to aquatic resources in the cooling 
pond for the same reasons reached in the 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, 
license amendments. The NRC staff's justification for this conclusion 
is as follows.
    The proposed increase in the allowable UHS average water 
temperature limit by 0.8 [deg]F (0.4 [deg]C) would not increase the 
likelihood of a fish kill event because the current TS limit for the 
UHS of 102.0 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C) already allows cooling pond 
temperatures above those at which fish species can be thermally 
stressed (95 [deg]F (35 [deg]C)). In effect, if the UHS temperature 
rises to the current TS limit, fish within or near the discharge canal, 
within the flow path between the discharge canal and UHS, or within the 
UHS itself would have already experienced thermal stress and possibly 
died. Thus, an incremental increase in the allowable UHS water 
temperature by 0.8 [deg]F (0.4 [deg]C) and the corresponding 
temperature increases within and near the discharge canal and within 
the flow path between the discharge canal and UHS would not 
significantly affect the number of fish kill events in the cooling 
pond. Additionally, the proposed action would only increase the 
allowable UHS average water temperature until September 30, 2024. Thus, 
any impacts to the aquatic communities in the managed cooling pond, if 
experienced, would be temporary in nature, and fish populations could 
recover quickly.
    While the proposed action would not affect the likelihood of a fish 
kill event occurring during periods when the average UHS water 
temperature approaches the TS limit, the proposed action could increase 
the number of fish killed per high temperature event. For fish with 
thermal tolerances at or near 95 [deg]F (35 [deg]C), there would likely 
be no significant difference in the number of affected fish per high 
temperature event because, as previously discussed, these fish could 
have already experienced thermal stress and possibly died, and the 
additional temperature increase would not measurably affect the 
mortality rate. For fish with thermal tolerances above 95 [deg]F (35 
[deg]C), such as bluegill, increased mortality is possible, as 
previously explained.
    In addition, scientific literature provides conflicting information 
as to whether incremental temperature increases would cause a 
subsequent increase in mortality rates of bluegill or other high-
temperature-tolerant fish when temperatures exceed 100 [deg]F (37.8 
[deg]C). For instance, in laboratory studies, Banner and Van Arman 
(1973) demonstrated 85 percent survival of juvenile bluegill after 24 
hours of exposure to 98.6 [deg]F (37.0 [deg]C) water for stock 
acclimated to 91.2 [deg]F (32.9 [deg]C). At 100.0 [deg]F (37.8 [deg]C), 
survival decreased to 25 percent, and at 100.4 [deg]F (38.0 [deg]C) and 
102.0 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C), no individuals survived. Even at 1 hour of 
exposure to 102.0 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C) water, average survival was 
relatively low between 40 to 67.5 percent per replicate. However, in 
another laboratory study, Cairns (1956 in Banner and Van Arman 1973) 
demonstrated that if juvenile bluegill were acclimated to higher 
temperatures at a 3.6 [deg]F (2.0 [deg]C) increase per day, individuals 
could tolerate water temperatures up to 102.6 [deg]F (39.2 [deg]C) with 
80 percent survival after 24 hours of exposure.
    Although these studies present inconsistent information on thermal 
tolerance limits, data from past fish kill events indicate that Cairns' 
study results more closely describe the cooling pond's bluegill 
population because the licensee has not reported bluegill as one of the 
species having been affected by past high temperature events. Thus, 
bluegills are likely acclimating to temperature rises at rates that 
allow individuals to remain in high temperature areas until 
temperatures

[[Page 61504]]

decrease or allow individuals time to seek refuge in cooler areas of 
the pond. Alternately, if Banner and Van Arman's results were more 
predictive, 75 percent or more of bluegill individuals in high 
temperature areas of the cooling pond could be expected to die at 
temperatures approaching or exceeding 100 [deg]F (37.8 [deg]C) for 24 
hours, and shorter exposure time would likely result in the death of 
some reduced percentage of bluegill individuals.
    Under the proposed action, fish exposure to temperatures 
approaching the proposed UHS TS average water temperature limit of 
102.8 [deg]F (39.3 [deg]C) and those exposed to the associated 
discharge for at least 1 hour could result in observable deaths. 
However, as stated previously, the licensee has not reported bluegill 
as one of the species that has been affected during past fish kills. 
Consequently, the NRC staff assumes that bluegill and other high-
temperature-tolerant species in the cooling pond would experience 
effects similar to those observed in Cairn's study. Based on Cairn's 
results, the proposed action's incremental and short-term temperature 
increase could result in the death of some additional high-temperature-
tolerant individuals, especially in cases where cooling pond 
temperatures rise dramatically over a short period of time (more than 
3.6 [deg]F (2.0 [deg]C) in a 24-hour period).
    Nonetheless, the discharge canal, flow path between the discharge 
canal and the UHS, and the UHS itself is a small portion of the cooling 
pond. Thus, while the incremental increase would likely increase the 
area over which cooling pond temperatures would rise, most of the 
cooling pond would remain at tolerable temperatures, and fish would be 
able to seek refuge in those cooler areas. Therefore, only fish within 
or near the discharge canal, within the flow path between the discharge 
canal and UHS, or within the UHS itself at the time of elevated 
temperatures would likely be affected, and fish would experience such 
effects to lessening degrees over the thermal gradient that extends 
from the discharge canal. This would not result in a significant 
difference in the number of fish killed per high temperature events for 
those species with thermal tolerances at or near 95 [deg]F (35 [deg]C) 
and an insignificant increase in the number of individuals affected for 
species with thermal tolerances above 95 [deg]F (35 [deg]C), such as 
bluegill. Additionally, the cooling pond is a managed ecosystem in 
which fish stocking, fishing pressure, and predator-prey relationships 
constitute the primary population pressures.
    Fish populations affected by fish kills generally recover quickly 
and, thus, fish kills do not appear to significantly influence the fish 
community structure. This is demonstrated by the fact that the species 
that are most often affected by high temperature events (threadfin shad 
and gizzard shad) are also among the most abundant species in the 
cooling pond. Managed species would continue to be assessed and stocked 
by the IDNR on an annual basis in accordance with the lease agreement 
between Constellation and IDNR. Continued stocking would mitigate any 
minor effects resulting from the proposed action. As previously stated 
in this notice, although authorized to operate up to 102.8 [deg]F (39.3 
[deg]C), at no time in the past 3 years did the UHS temperature exceed 
102 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C).
    Based on the foregoing analysis, the NRC staff concludes that the 
proposed action would not result in significant impacts to aquatic 
resources in the cooling pond. Some terrestrial species, such as birds 
or other wildlife, rely on fish or other aquatic resources from the 
cooling pond as a source of food. The NRC staff does not expect any 
significant impacts to birds or other wildlife because, if a fish kill 
occurs, the number of dead fish would be a small proportion of the 
total population of fish in the cooling pond. Furthermore, during fish 
kills, birds and other wildlife could consume many of the floating, 
dead fish. Additionally, and as described previously, the NRC staff 
does not expect that the proposed action would result in a significant 
difference in the number or intensity of fish kill events or otherwise 
result in significant impacts on aquatic resources in the cooling pond.
    With respect to water resources and ecological resources along and 
within the Kankakee River, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency 
imposes regulatory controls on Braidwood's thermal effluent through 
title 35, Environmental Protection, section 302, ``Water Quality 
Standards,'' of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC 302) and 
through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) 
permitting process pursuant to the Clean Water Act. Section 302 of the 
Illinois Administrative Code stipulates that ``[t]he maximum 
temperature rise shall not exceed 2.8 [deg]C (5 [deg]F) above natural 
receiving water body temperatures,'' (35 IAC 302.211(d)) and that 
``[w]ater temperature at representative locations in the main river 
shall at no time exceed 33.7 [deg]C (93 [deg]F) from April through 
November and 17.7 [deg]C (63 [deg]F) in other months'' (35 IAC 
302.211(e)). Additional stipulations pertaining to the mixing zone 
further protect water resources and biota from thermal effluents. The 
Braidwood NPDES permit contains special conditions that mirror these 
temperature requirements and that stipulate more detailed temperature 
requirements at the edge of the mixing zone. Under the proposed action, 
Braidwood thermal effluent would continue to be limited by the Illinois 
Administrative Code and the Braidwood NPDES permit to ensure that 
Braidwood operations do not create adverse effects on water or 
ecological resources along or within the Kankakee River. Occasionally, 
the licensee has applied for a provisional variance to allow higher-
than-permitted temperatures at the edge of the discharge mixing zone. 
For instance, Exelon, the license holder at the time, applied for and 
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) granted one 
provisional variance in 2012 during a period of extremely warm weather 
and little to no precipitation. Constellation reported no fish kills or 
other events to the IEPA and the NRC that would indicate adverse 
environmental effects resulting from the provisional variance. The 
details of this provisional variance are described in section 4.7.1.3 
of the Braidwood FSEIS.
    Under the proposed action, Constellation would remain subject to 
the regulatory controls described in this notice. The NRC staff finds 
it reasonable to assume that Constellation's continued compliance with, 
and the State's continued enforcement of, the Illinois Administrative 
Code and the Braidwood NPDES permit would ensure that Kankakee River 
water and ecological resources are protected. Further, the proposed 
action would not alter the types or amounts of effluents being 
discharged to the river as blowdown. Therefore, the NRC staff does not 
expect any significant impacts to water or ecological resources within 
and along the Kankakee River from temporarily increasing the allowable 
UHS average water temperature TS limit.
    With respect to Federally listed species, the NRC staff consulted 
with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) pursuant to section 7 of 
the ESA during its license renewal environmental review for Braidwood. 
During that consultation, the NRC staff found that the sheepnose 
(Plethobasus cyphyus) and snuffbox (Epioblasma triquetra) mussels had 
the potential to occur in the areas that would be directly or 
indirectly affected by license renewal (i.e., the action area). In 
September 2015, Exelon transmitted the results of a mussel survey to 
the NRC and the FWS. The survey documented the

[[Page 61505]]

absence of Federally listed mussels near the Braidwood discharge site 
in the Kankakee River. Based on this survey and other information 
described in the Braidwood FSEIS, the NRC concluded that license 
renewal may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect the sheepnose 
mussel, and the NRC determined that license renewal would have no 
effect on the snuffbox mussel. The FWS concurred with the NRC's ``not 
likely to adversely affect'' determination in a letter dated October 
20, 2015. The results of the consultation are further summarized in the 
Record of Decision for Braidwood license renewal.
    As previously described, the impacts of the proposed action would 
be confined to the UHS cooling pond and would not affect water or 
ecological resources along and within the Kankakee River. The NRC's 
previous ESA, section 7, consultation confirmed that no Federally 
listed aquatic species occur within or near the cooling pond. The NRC 
has not identified any information indicating the presence of Federally 
listed species in the area since consultation was concluded, and the 
FWS has not listed any new aquatic species that may occur in the area 
since that time. The proposed action would not result in any 
disturbance or other impacts to terrestrial habitats and, thus, no 
Federally listed terrestrial species would be affected. Accordingly, 
the NRC staff concludes that the proposed action would have no effect 
on Federally listed species or designated critical habitat. 
Consultation with the FWS regarding the proposed action is not 
necessary because the NRC staff has determined that the proposed action 
will have no effect on listed species or critical habitat.
    The NRC staff has identified no foreseeable land use, visual 
resource, noise, or waste management impacts given that the proposed 
action would not result in any physical changes to Braidwood facilities 
or equipment or changes any land uses on or off site. The NRC staff has 
identified no air quality impacts given that the proposed action would 
not result in air emissions beyond what would be experienced during 
current operations. Additionally, there would be no socioeconomic, 
environmental justice, or historic and cultural resource impacts 
associated with the proposed action since no physical changes would 
occur beyond the site boundaries and any impacts would be limited to 
the cooling pond.
    Based on the discussion and findings previously described in this 
EA, the NRC concludes that the proposed action would not significantly 
affect plant safety and would not have a significant adverse effect on 
the probability of an accident occurring. In addition, there would be 
no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associated with 
the proposed action. Accordingly, the NRC concludes that the proposed 
action would have no significant environmental effect on the quality of 
the human environment.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC staff considered 
the denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' 
alternative). Denial of the proposed action would result in no changes 
to the current TS. Therefore, the licensee would continue to be 
required to place Braidwood in hot standby (Mode 3) if average UHS 
water temperatures exceed 102 [deg]F (38.9 [deg]C). The no-action 
alternative would result in no change in current environmental 
conditions or impacts at Braidwood beyond those considered in the 
Braidwood FSEIS.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    No additional agencies or persons were consulted regarding the 
environmental impact of the proposed action.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    Constellation submitted a license amendment request in accordance 
with 10 CFR 50.90. The request seeks to amend Renewed Facility 
Operating License Nos. NPF-72 and NPF-77, issued to Constellation for 
operation of Braidwood. The amendments would revise TS SR in TS 3.7.9.2 
to allow a temporary increase in the allowable UHS average temperature 
of less than or equal to (<=) 102.8 [deg]F (39.3 degrees Celsius 
([deg]C)) through September 30, 2024. The NRC is considering the 
requested amendments.
    In addition, the NRC staff conducted an environmental review of the 
proposed action, and prepared an EA, which is provided in Section II of 
this notice and is incorporated by reference in this FONSI. The NRC 
determined the proposed action would not significantly affect plant 
safety, would not have a significant adverse effect on the probability 
of an accident occurring, and would not have any significant 
radiological or nonradiological impacts. Based on the EA, the NRC staff 
has concluded that the proposed action will not have a significant 
impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its finding, 
the NRC has decided not to prepare an environmental impact statement 
for the proposed action.
    As required by 10 CFR 51.32(a)(5), the related environmental 
document is the ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License 
Renewal of Nuclear Plants: Regarding Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    In accordance with section 51.118 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Final environmental impact statement--
notice of availability,'' the NRC is making available for public 
inspection NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, Second Renewal, regarding the 
subsequent license renewal of Virginia Electric and Power Company's 
(Dominion), renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-4 and NPF-7 for 
an additional 20 years of operation for NAPS. A notice of availability 
of the site-specific draft EIS (DEIS) (NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, 
Second Renewal) was published in the Federal Register on January 8, 
2024, (89 FR 960) by the NRC, and on January 5, 2024 (89 FR 781) as 
amended January 19, 2024 (89 FR 3653), by the Environmental Protection 
Agency. The public comment period on the site-specific DEIS (NUREG-
1437, Supplement 7a, Second Renewal) ended on February 22, 2024, and 
the comments received on the site-specific DEIS are addressed in the 
final EIS (NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, Second Renewal).

II. Discussion

    The site-specific draft EIS (NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, Second 
Renewal) superseded a draft Supplemental EIS (SEIS) (NUREG-1437, 
Supplement 7, Second Renewal), that the NRC had issued for public 
comment on August 25, 2021 (86 FR 47525). The site-specific final EIS 
addresses the comments received on both the site-specific draft EIS 
(NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, Second Renewal) and the previous draft SEIS 
(NUREG-1437, Supplement 7, Second Renewal). As discussed in Chapter 4 
of the final EIS (NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, Second Renewal), the NRC 
staff has determined that the adverse environmental impacts of 
subsequent license renewal for NAPS for an additional 20 years beyond 
the expiration dates of the initial renewed licenses are not so great 
that preserving the option of subsequent license renewal for energy-
planning decisionmakers would be unreasonable. This recommendation is 
based on: (1) information provided in the environmental report, as 
supplemented, and other documents submitted by Dominion; (2) 
consultation with Federal, State, Tribal, and local governmental 
agencies; (3) the NRC staff's independent environmental review; and (4) 
consideration of public comments received during the scoping process, 
on the site-specific DEIS (NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, Second Renewal), 
and on the previous draft SEIS (NUREG-1437, Supplement 7, Second 
Renewal).

    Dated: July 26, 2024.

Support, Office of Nuclear Material Safety, and Safeguards.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 50-348 and 30-364; NRC-2024-0134]


Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc.; Joseph M. Farley 
Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; License Amendment Application

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Opportunity to comment, request a hearing, and petition for 
leave to intervene; order imposing procedures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering 
issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-2 and 
NPF-8, issued to Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. (SNC, the 
licensee), for operation of the Joseph M. Farley Nuclear Plant, 
(Farley) Units 1 and 2. The requested amendment would revise the 
operating license, Appendix A, Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.5, 
``Containment Air Temperature,'' actions upon exceeding the containment 
average air temperature limit of 120 degrees Fahrenheit ([deg]F) and 
remove an expired Note provision. Specifically, the proposed amendment 
would revise TS 3.6.5 Required Actions and Completion Time A.1, add 
Required Actions and Completion Times A.2 and A.3, as well as remove an 
expired Note in TS 3.6.5 Limiting Conditions for Operation. For this 
amendment request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no 
significant hazards consideration. Because this amendment request 
contains sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an 
order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention 
preparation.

II. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility 
Operating License No. NPF-2 and NPF-8, issued to SNC, for operation of 
the Farley, Units 1 and 2, located in Houston County, Alabama.
    By letter dated July 18, 2024 (ADAMS Accession Nos. ML24201A107 
non-publicly available; ML24201A108 publicly available), SNC submitted 
a license amendment request to change TS 3.6.5, ``Containment Air 
Temperature,'' at Farley, Units 1 and 2. SNC proposes to revise TS 
3.6.5 Required Action and Completion Time A.1, add Required Actions and 
Completion Times A.2, and A.3, as well as remove an expired note in TS 
3.6.5 Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO). Specifically, the change 
would modify the TS 3.6.5 Actions if containment average air 
temperature exceeds the LCO of 120 [deg]F to allow continued operation 
for up to seven cumulative days per calendar year provided that the 
containment average air temperature does not exceed 122 [deg]F 
(verified within eight hours of containment average air temperature 
exceeding 120 [deg]F and once per eight hours thereafter) and that 
refueling water storage tank temperature remains less than or equal to 
100 [deg]F (verified within eight hours of containment average air 
temperature exceeding 120 [deg]F and once per eight hours thereafter).
    Before any issuance of the proposed license amendment, the NRC will 
need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and NRC's regulations.
    The NRC has made a proposed determination that the license 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under 
the NRC's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the 
facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) 
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new 
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; 
or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of 
the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented 
as follows:
    1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No, the proposed changes do not adversely affect the 
operation of any structures, systems, or components (SSCs) associated 
with an accident initiator or initiating sequence of events. The 
proposed changes do not affect the design of the containment heat 
removal systems.
    The proposed amendment does not affect accident initiators or 
precursors nor adversely alter the design assumptions, conditions, and 
configuration of the facility. The proposed amendment does not alter 
any plant equipment or operating practices with respect to such 
initiators or precursors in a manner that the probability of an 
accident is increased. The proposed amendment to allow exceeding the 
containment average air temperature above the current limit of 120 
[deg]F up to a maximum of 122 [deg]F for up to seven cumulative days in 
the calendar year and remove an expired

[[Page 60932]]

Note does not adversely affect the operation of the assumed mitigation 
systems or the containment fission product barrier assumptions. As 
demonstrated in the SNC request, the potential increase in containment 
average air temperature coupled with limiting the refueling water 
storage tank (RWST) temperature to 100 [deg]F is more than offset by 
existing margins in the safety analyses. As such, the proposed change 
will not alter assumptions relative to the mitigation of an accident or 
transient event. The proposed amendment does not increase the 
likelihood of the malfunction of an SSC or adversely impact analyzed 
accidents.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated.
    2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No, the proposed amendment does not introduce any new or 
unanalyzed modes of operation. The proposed changes do not involve a 
physical alteration to the plant (i.e., no new or different type of 
equipment will be installed) or a change to the methods governing 
normal plant operation. The changes do not alter the limiting 
assumptions made in the safety analysis.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a 
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated.
    3. Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety?
    Response: No, the margin of safety is related to the ability of the 
fission product barriers to perform their design functions during and 
following an accident. These barriers include the fuel cladding, the 
reactor coolant system, and the containment. The fission product 
barriers continue to be able to perform their required functions; based 
on the pre-existing margins and conservatisms currently assumed in the 
safety analyses. Therefore, the margins to the onsite and offsite 
radiological dose limits are not significantly reduced. Therefore, the 
proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of 
safety.
    The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on 
this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration.
    The NRC is seeking public comments on this proposed determination 
that the license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue the license amendment before expiration of the 60-
day period provided that its final determination is that the amendment 
involves no significant hazards consideration. In addition, the 
Commission may issue the amendment prior to the expiration of the 30-
day comment period if circumstances change during the 30-day comment 
period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for 
example, in derating or shutdown of the facility. If the Commission 
takes action prior to the expiration of either the comment period or 
the notice period, it will publish a notice of issuance in the Federal 
Register. If the Commission make a final no significant hazards 
consideration determination, any hearing will take place after 
issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will 
occur very infrequently.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at

[[Page 60933]]

https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    For further details with respect to this action, see the 
application for license amendment dated July 18, 2024, (ADAMS Accession 
Nos. ML24201A107 non-publicly available; ML24201A108 publicly 
available).

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information for Contention Preparation

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI).
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of hearing or 
opportunity for hearing, any potential party who believes access to 
SUNSI is necessary to respond to this notice may request access to 
SUNSI. A ``potential party'' is any person who intends to participate 
as a party by demonstrating standing and filing an admissible 
contention under 10 CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI submitted 
later than 10 days after publication of this notice will not be 
considered absent a showing of good cause for the late filing, 
addressing why the request could not have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemakings and 
Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy General Counsel 
for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the General 
Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001. 
The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both offices is: 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, 
Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the Secretary and 
the Office of the General Counsel are [email protected] and 
[email protected], respectively.\1\ The request must 
include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI under these 
procedures should be submitted as described in this paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice;
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1); and
    (3) The identity of the individual or entity requesting access to 
SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the need for the information in 
order to meaningfully participate in this adjudicatory proceeding. In 
particular, the request

[[Page 60934]]

must explain why publicly available versions of the information 
requested would not be sufficient to provide the basis and specificity 
for a proffered contention.
    D. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraph C, the NRC staff will determine within 10 days of receipt of 
the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI.
    E. If the NRC staff determines that the requestor satisfies both 
D.(1) and D.(2), the NRC staff will notify the requestor in writing 
that access to SUNSI has been granted. The written notification will 
contain instructions on how the requestor may obtain copies of the 
requested documents, and any other conditions that may apply to access 
to those documents. These conditions may include, but are not limited 
to, the signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or 
Protective Order \2\ setting forth terms and conditions to prevent the 
unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of SUNSI by each individual who 
will be granted access to SUNSI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    F. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 days after 
receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more than 25 
days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) the 
information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing), the 
petitioner may file its SUNSI contentions by that later deadline.
    G. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI is denied by the NRC staff 
after a determination on standing and requisite need, the NRC staff 
shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly stating the 
reason or reasons for the denial.
    (2) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination by filing a challenge within 5 days of receipt of that 
determination with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    (3) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    H. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest independent of the proceeding. 
Such a challenge must be filed within 5 days of the notification by the 
NRC staff of its grant of access and must be filed with: (a) the 
presiding officer designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another administrative judge, or an 
Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); 
or (c) if another officer has been designated to rule on information 
access issues, with that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or denying access) is governed by 10 
CFR 2.311.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562; August 3, 2012, 78 FR 34247, June 7, 2013) apply to 
appeals of NRC staff determinations (because they must be served on 
a presiding officer or the Commission, as applicable), but not to 
the initial SUNSI request submitted to the NRC staff under these 
procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests 
for access to SUNSI, and motions for protective orders, in a timely 
fashion in order to minimize any unnecessary delays in identifying 
those petitioners who have standing and who have propounded contentions 
meeting the specificity and basis requirements in 10 CFR part 2. The 
attachment to this Order summarizes the general target schedule for 
processing and resolving requests under these procedures.
    It is so ordered.

    Dated: July 24, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

                            supporting the standing of a potential party
                            identified by name and address; and (ii)
                            describing the need for the information in

                            formulation does not require access to SUNSI
                            (+25 Answers to petition for intervention;

20.......................  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
                            staff informs the requestor of the staff's
                            determination whether the request for access
                            provides a reasonable basis to believe
                            standing can be established and shows need
                            for SUNSI. (NRC staff also informs any party
                            to the proceeding whose interest independent
                            of the proceeding would be harmed by the
                            release of the information.) If NRC staff
                            makes the finding of need for SUNSI and
                            likelihood of standing, NRC staff begins
                            document processing (preparation of
                            redactions or review of redacted documents).

                            denial of access; NRC staff files copy of
                            access determination with the presiding
                            officer (or Chief Administrative Judge or
                            other designated officer, as appropriate).
                            If NRC staff finds ``need'' for SUNSI, the

                            whose interest independent of the proceeding
                            would be harmed by the release of the
                            information to file a motion seeking a
                            ruling to reverse the NRC staff's grant of
                            access.

DG-1290 is proposed Revision 3 of RG 1.59 of the same name and DG-1417 
is proposed new RG 1.256. DG-1290 provides guidance for applicants for 
new nuclear power plants on acceptable methods for evaluating design-
basis floods and DG-1417 provides guidance for applicants on flooding 
hazards due to failure or other incidents at man-made water control 
structures including, but not limited to, dams and levees. The public 
comment period was originally scheduled to close on August 14, 2024. 
The NRC has decided to extend the public comment period on these 
documents until September 13,

II. Discussion

    As directed in SRM-SECY-11-0089, ``Options for Proceeding with 
Future Level 3 Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Activities,'' the 
staff is conducting a full-scope multi-unit site Level 3 PRA (Level 3 
PRA project) that addresses all internal and external hazards; all 
plant operating modes; and all reactor units, spent fuel pools, and dry 
cask storage (DCS). The reference site for this study contains two 
four-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactors with large dry 
containments. The objectives of the Level 3 PRA project are to (1) 
develop a Level 3 PRA, generally based on current state-of-practice 
methods, tools, and data, that (a) reflects technical advances since 
the last NRC-sponsored Level 3 PRAs (NUREG-1150), which were completed 
over 30 years ago, and (b) addresses scope considerations that were not 
previously considered (e.g., low-power and shutdown risk, multi-unit 
risk, other radiological sources); (2) extract new insights to enhance 
regulatory decision making and to help focus limited NRC resources on 
issues most directly related to the agency's mission to protect public 
health and safety; (3) enhance PRA staff capability and expertise and 
improve documentation practices to make PRA information more 
accessible, retrievable, and understandable; and (4) demonstrate 
technical feasibility and evaluate the realistic cost of developing new 
Level 3 PRAs.
    The work performed under this project is being documented as a 
multi-volume report. The current Level 3 PRA project report (Volume 7) 
describes the analyses and results for the DCS PRA. The Level 3 PRA 
project DCS PRA is a site-specific and cask-specific analysis that 
consists of the following interrelated technical elements: initiating 
event analysis, structural analysis, thermal analysis, human 
reliability analysis, multipurpose canister failure analysis, systems 
analysis, consequence analysis, and risk results quantification. The 
study predicted that there would be no prompt fatalities from DCS 
within 10 miles of the site. Results are reported for several other 
consequence metrics, including individual latent cancer fatality risk, 
total latent cancer fatality cases, population dose from 0-50 miles and 
0-100 miles, economic cost, and population affected by intermediate 
phase relocation. Regardless of the consequence metric, the risk from 
DCS operations was calculated to be very low.

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Voluntary Reporting of Performance Indicators.'' The NRC hereby 
informs potential respondents that an agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and that a person is not required to respond to, a collection 
of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on March 5, 2024, 89 FR 15903.
    1. The title of the information collection: Voluntary Reporting of 
Performance Indicators.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0195.
    3. Type of submission: Revision.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Quarterly for 
Performance Indicator reporting and, on occasion, for the Frequently 
Asked Question process.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Power reactor 
licensees.

[[Page 58776]]

    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 400 (379 reporting 
responses + 21 recordkeepers).
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 94.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 82,034 (80,960 hours 
reporting + 1,074 hours recordkeeping).
    10. Abstract: As part of a joint industry-NRC initiative, the NRC 
receives information submitted voluntarily by power reactor licensees 
regarding selected performance attributes known as performance 
indicators (PIs). PIs are objective measures of the performance of 
licensee systems or programs. The NRC uses PI information and 
inspection results in its Reactor Oversight Process (ROP) to make 
decisions about plant performance and regulatory response. Licensees 
transmit PIs electronically to reduce burden on themselves and the NRC. 
Licensees also participate in the ROP Performance Indicator Frequently 
Asked Question (FAQ) process that it is used to resolve interpretation 
issues with Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) document, NEI 99-02, 
``Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guideline.'' The ROP PI 
FAQ process and white papers may also be used to propose changes to NEI 
99-02 guidance and the PI Program. The NRC and industry review FAQs and 
white papers and work to achieve resolution during periodic public 
meetings.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 50-390, 50-391, and 72-1048; NRC-2024-0118]

Tennessee Valley Authority; Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; 
Exemption

I. Background

    The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is the holder of Facility 
Operating License Nos. NPF-90 and NPF-96, and General License No. 72-
1048, for operation of the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, and 
an independent spent fuel storage installation (Watts Bar site), 
respectively, located in Rhea County, Tennessee. The operating licenses 
are subject to all applicable provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, and 
to the rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC or Commission) now or hereafter in effect.

II. Request/Action

    By letter dated September 28, 2023 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML23271A063), as supplemented 
on March 14, 2024 (ML24074A457), TVA requested an exemption from the 
requirement in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
part 37, paragraph 37.11(c)(2) to use a locked door or gate at the 
access control point to where radioactive waste

[[Page 58774]]

that contains category 1 or category 2 quantities of radioactive 
material is stored.
    The provisions of 10 CFR part 37 establish physical security 
requirements to prevent the theft or diversion of risk-significant 
radioactive materials (i.e., category 1 and category 2 quantities of 
radioactive material). As stated in NUREG-2155, Rev. 2, 
``Implementation Guidance for 10 CFR part 37, `Physical Protection of 
Category 1 and Category 2 Quantities of Radioactive Material''' 
(ML22083A141), 10 CFR 37.11 exempts radioactive wastes that contain 
category 2 quantities or greater of radioactive material from the 
security requirements in subparts B, C, and D of 10 CFR part 37. 
Instead, the radioactive waste is subject to the requirements in 10 CFR 
37.11(c)(1) through (c)(4). The regulation at 10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) 
requires that the licensee secure the radioactive waste by a locked 
door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point.
    The Watts Bar site includes old steam generator storage facilities 
(OSGSFs) that are used to store the contaminated old steam generators 
(OSGs). The OSGs exceed the threshold for a category 2 quantity of 
radioactivity, as defined in 10 CFR 37.5, but do not contain discrete 
radioactive sources, ion-exchange resins, or activated materials that 
weigh less than 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds), as described in 10 CFR 
37.11(c). As such, the licensee is required by 10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) to 
have a monitored alarm at the access control point to the OSGSFs where 
the OSGs are stored.
    TVA describes the OSGSFs as robust structures that are closed with 
10 stacked precast concrete panels weighing approximately 17,237 
kilograms (38,000 pounds) each. The OSGSFs are located outside the 
Watts Bar protected area, but within the exclusion area and site 
boundary. Removal of the concrete panels is the only access point of 
sufficient size to remove an OSG and requires heavy lifting and rigging 
equipment that cannot be staged or utilized quickly. Removal of the 
concrete panels is an evolution that is easily observable over an 
extended period of time.
    TVA has requested a permanent exemption from the requirement in 10 
CFR 37.11(c)(2) to address a regulatory noncompliance that has resulted 
in the issuance of minor violations at the Watts Bar site.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 37.11(a), the Commission may, upon application 
of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant such 
exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in 10 CFR part 37 
as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life or 
property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the 
public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    The exemption would exempt the licensee from the requirement to 
have a monitored alarm at the access control point to the OSGSFs where 
the OSGs are stored. As stated previously, 10 CFR 37.11(a) allows the 
NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 37. The 
NRC staff has determined that granting of the exemption is permissible 
under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and other regulatory 
requirements. Therefore, the exemption is authorized by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    The purpose of 10 CFR part 37 is to provide reasonable assurance of 
the security of category 1 or category 2 quantities of radioactive 
material by protecting these materials from theft or diversion. As 
required by 10 CFR 37.11, each licensee that possesses radioactive 
waste that contains category 1 or category 2 quantity of radioactive 
material shall implement the following requirements to secure the 
radioactive waste: (1) use continuous physical barriers that allow 
access to the radioactive waste only through established access control 
points; (2) use a locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the 
access control point; (3) assess and respond to each actual or 
attempted unauthorized access to determine whether an actual or 
attempted theft, sabotage, or diversion occurred; and (4) immediately 
notify the local law enforcement agency (LLEA) and request an armed 
response from the LLEA upon determination that there was an actual or 
attempted theft, sabotage, or diversion of the radioactive waste that 
contains category 1 or category 2 quantities of radioactive material.
    After issuance of the final part 37 rule, the NRC issued 
Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 2014-001, ``Interim Guidance for 
Dispositioning 10 CFR part 37 Violations with Respect to Large 
Components or Robust Structures Containing Category 1 or Category 2 
Quantities of Material at Power Reactor Facilities Licensed Under 10 
CFR parts 50 and 52'' (ML14056A151), on March 13, 2014, to provide 
guidance to NRC staff for dispositioning violations associated with 10 
CFR part 37 with respect to large components containing category 1 and 
category 2 quantities of radioactive material stored in robust 
structures at power reactor facilities licensed under 10 CFR parts 50 
and 52. The EGM acknowledges that due to their size and weight, these 
large components are not easily moved without cranes, rigging, and 
heavy equipment. In addition, these large components are not easily 
concealed during loading or when they are in motion, and the amount of 
time required to steal or divert these large components is such that it 
is reasonable to expect that the licensee would detect these 
activities.
    TVA has a written 10 CFR part 37 security plan for Watts Bar that 
identifies the OSGs as large components and the OSGSFs as robust 
structures containing category 1 or category 2 quantities of 
radioactive material. The plan also identifies the security measures 
that are adequate to detect, assess, and respond to actual or attempted 
theft or diversion of stored materials from the OSGSFs. TVA provided a 
written analysis that considers the time needed to accomplish these 
activities given the proximity and mobility of the equipment available 
for the large components and robust structures supporting the 10 CFR 
part 37 security plan. TVA also provided a written analysis documenting 
that the measures for the protection of large components or robust 
structures containing category 1 or category 2 quantities of material 
do not decrease the effectiveness of the 10 CFR part 73 security plan.
    Because TVA has a security plan that contains measures to control 
access to the radioactive waste, assess and respond to unauthorized 
access, and notify and request an armed response by the LLEA, the NRC 
finds that the exemption will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is in the Public Interest

    TVA stated that the exemption would preclude the expenditure of 
resources that provide no additional security and protection for the 
OSGs. Granting of the exemption would also allow TVA to address a 
regulatory noncompliance and avoid future violations.
    As noted previously, the OSGs are large components that are stored 
in robust structures that would require the use of heavy lifting and 
rigging equipment that cannot be staged or utilized quickly. Requiring 
the use of a

[[Page 58775]]

locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point is 
supplanted by the licensee's security plan which utilizes other means 
to detect unauthorized access, while the exemption would reduce the 
regulatory burden on the licensee and the NRC staff. Therefore, the NRC 
staff concludes that the exemption is in the public interest.

IV. Environmental Considerations

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, 51.32, and 51.35, an environmental 
assessment and finding of no significant impact regarding this 
exemption request was published in the Federal Register on June 27, 
2024 (89 FR 53665). Based upon the environmental assessment, the 
Commission has determined that issuance of this exemption will not have 
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

V. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
37.11(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or 
property or the common defense and security, and is in the public 
interest.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

[Docket Nos. 50-259, 50-260, 50-296, and 72-052; NRC-2024-0114]

Tennessee Valley Authority; Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2, and 
3; Exemption

I. Background

    The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is the holder of Renewed 
Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33, DPR-52, and DPR-68, and General 
License No. 72-052, which authorize the operation of the Browns Ferry 
Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2, and 3, and an independent spent fuel storage 
installation (Browns Ferry or Browns Ferry site), respectively, located 
in Limestone County, Alabama. The renewed operating licenses are 
subject to all applicable provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, and to 
the rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC or Commission) now or hereafter in effect.

II. Request/Action

    By letter dated September 28, 2023 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML23271A063), as supplemented 
on March 14, 2024 (ML24074A457), TVA requested an exemption from the 
requirement in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
part 37, paragraph 37.11(c)(2) to use a locked door or gate at the 
access control point to where radioactive waste that contains category 
1 or category 2 quantities of radioactive material is stored.
    The provisions of 10 CFR part 37 establish physical security 
requirements to prevent the theft or diversion of risk-significant 
radioactive materials (i.e., category 1 and category 2 quantities of 
radioactive material). As stated in NUREG-2155, Rev. 2, 
``Implementation Guidance for 10 CFR part 37, ``Physical Protection of 
Category 1 and Category 2 Quantities of Radioactive Material'''' 
(ML22083A141), 10 CFR 37.11 exempts radioactive wastes that contain 
category 2 quantities or greater of radioactive material from the 
security requirements in subparts B, C, and D of 10 CFR part 37. 
Instead, the radioactive waste is subject to the requirements in 10 CFR 
37.11(c)(1) through (c)(4). The

[[Page 58777]]

regulation at 10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) requires that the licensee secure the 
radioactive waste by a locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the 
access control point.
    The Browns Ferry site includes a low-level radioactive waste 
storage facility (LLRWSF) that is used to store the original steam 
dryers for Browns Ferry, which were removed during the extended power 
uprate outages. The steam dryers exceed the threshold for a category 2 
quantity of radioactivity, as defined in 10 CFR 37.5, but do not 
contain discrete radioactive sources, ion-exchange resins, or activated 
materials that weigh less than 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds), as 
described in 10 CFR 37.11(c). As such, the licensee is required by 10 
CFR 37.11(c)(2) to have a monitored alarm at the access control point 
to the LLRWSF vaults where the steam dryers are stored.
    TVA describes the LLRWSF as a robust structure consisting of a 
group of rectangular box-type concrete storage modules that are located 
outside the Browns Ferry protected area, but inside the owner-
controlled area and exclusion zone. Each LLRWSF storage module is 
closed by five precast concrete caps, weighing approximately 45,813 
kilograms (101,000 pounds) each. Removal of the caps is the only access 
point to the stored steam dryers and requires heavy lifting and rigging 
equipment that cannot be staged or utilized quickly. Removal of the 
caps is an evolution that is easily observable over an extended period 
of time.
    TVA has requested a permanent exemption from the requirement in 10 
CFR 37.11(c)(2) to address a regulatory noncompliance that has resulted 
in the issuance of minor violations at the Browns Ferry site.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 37.11(a), the Commission may, upon application 
of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant such 
exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in 10 CFR part 37 
as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life or 
property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the 
public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    The exemption would exempt the licensee from the requirement to 
have a monitored alarm at the access control point to the LLRWSF vaults 
where the steam dryers are stored. As stated previously, 10 CFR 
37.11(a) allows the NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 
CFR part 37. The NRC staff has determined that granting of the 
exemption is permissible under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, and other regulatory requirements. Therefore, the exemption is 
authorized by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    The purpose of 10 CFR part 37 is to provide reasonable assurance of 
the security of category 1 or category 2 quantities of radioactive 
material by protecting these materials from theft or diversion. As 
required by 10 CFR 37.11, each licensee that possesses radioactive 
waste that contains category 1 or category 2 quantity of radioactive 
material shall implement the following requirements to secure the 
radioactive waste: (1) use continuous physical barriers that allow 
access to the radioactive waste only through established access control 
points; (2) use a locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the 
access control point; (3) assess and respond to each actual or 
attempted unauthorized access to determine whether an actual or 
attempted theft, sabotage, or diversion occurred; and (4) immediately 
notify the local law enforcement agency (LLEA) and request an armed 
response from the LLEA upon determination that there was an actual or 
attempted theft, sabotage, or diversion of the radioactive waste that 
contains category 1 or category 2 quantities of radioactive material.
    After issuance of the final part 37 rule, the NRC issued 
Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 2014-001, ``Interim Guidance for 
Dispositioning 10 CFR part 37 Violations with Respect to Large 
Components or Robust Structures Containing Category 1 or Category 2 
Quantities of Material at Power Reactor Facilities Licensed Under 10 
CFR parts 50 and 52'' (ML14056A151), on March 13, 2014, to provide 
guidance to NRC staff for dispositioning violations associated with 10 
CFR part 37 with respect to large components containing category 1 and 
category 2 quantities of radioactive material stored in robust 
structures at power reactor facilities licensed under 10 CFR parts 50 
and 52. The EGM acknowledges that due to their size and weight, these 
large components are not easily moved without cranes, rigging, and 
heavy equipment. In addition, these large components are not easily 
concealed during loading or when they are in motion, and the amount of 
time required to steal or divert these large components is such that it 
is reasonable to expect that the licensee would detect these 
activities.
    TVA has a written 10 CFR part 37 security plan for Browns Ferry 
that identifies the original steam dryers as large components and the 
LLRWSF as a robust structure containing category 1 or category 2 
quantities of radioactive material. The plan also identifies the 
security measures that are adequate to detect, assess, and respond to 
actual or attempted theft or diversion of stored materials from the 
LLRWSF. TVA provided a written analysis that considers the time needed 
to accomplish these activities given the proximity and mobility of the 
equipment available for the large components and robust structures 
supporting the 10 CFR part 37 security plan. TVA also provided a 
written analysis documenting that the measures for the protection of 
large components or robust structures containing category 1 or category 
2 quantities of material do not decrease the effectiveness of the 10 
CFR part 73 security plan.
    Because TVA has a security plan that contains measures to control 
access to the radioactive waste, assess and respond to unauthorized 
access, and notify and request an armed response by the LLEA, the NRC 
finds that the exemption will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is in the Public Interest

    TVA stated that the exemption would preclude the expenditure of 
resources that provide no additional security and protection for the 
stored steam dryers. Granting of the exemption would also allow TVA to 
address a regulatory noncompliance and avoid future violations.
    As noted previously, the original steam dryers are large components 
that are stored in robust structures that would require the use of 
heavy lifting and rigging equipment that cannot be staged or utilized 
quickly. Requiring the use of a locked door or gate with monitored 
alarm at the access control point is supplanted by the licensee's 
security plan which utilizes other means to detect unauthorized access, 
while the exemption would reduce the regulatory burden on the licensee 
and the NRC staff. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that the 
exemption is in the public interest.

IV. Environmental Considerations

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, 51.32, and 51.35, an environmental 
assessment and finding of no significant impact regarding this 
exemption request was

[[Page 58778]]

published in the Federal Register on June 27, 2024 (89 FR 53663). Based 
upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has determined that 
issuance of this exemption will not have a significant effect on the 
quality of the human environment.

V. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
37.11(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or 
property or the common defense and security, and is in the public 
interest.

Tennessee Valley Authority; Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; 
Exemption

I. Background

    The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is the holder of Renewed 
Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-77 and DPR-79, and General License 
No. 72-034, for operation of the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, 
and an independent spent fuel storage installation (Sequoyah or 
Sequoyah site), respectively, located in Hamilton County, Tennessee. 
The renewed operating licenses are subject to all applicable provisions 
of the Atomic Energy Act, and to the rules, regulations, and orders of 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) now or 
hereafter in effect.

II. Request/Action

    By letter dated September 28, 2023 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML23271A063), as supplemented 
on March 14, 2024 (ML24074A457), TVA requested an exemption from the 
requirement in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
part 37, paragraph 37.11(c)(2) to use a locked door or gate at the

    The provisions of 10 CFR part 37 establish physical security 
requirements to prevent the theft or diversion of risk-significant 
radioactive materials (i.e., category 1 and category 2 quantities of 
radioactive material). As stated in NUREG-2155, Rev. 2, 
``Implementation Guidance for 10 CFR part 37, ``Physical Protection of

requires that the licensee secure the radioactive waste by a locked 
door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point.
    The Sequoyah site includes old steam generator storage facilities 
(OSGSFs) that are used to store the contaminated old steam generators 
(OSGs). The OSGs exceed the threshold for a category 2 quantity of 
radioactivity, as defined in 10 CFR 37.5, but do not contain discrete 
radioactive sources, ion-exchange resins, or activated materials that 
weigh less than 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds), as described in 10 CFR 
37.11(c). As such, the licensee is required by 10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) to 
have a monitored alarm at the access control

[[Page 58804]]

point to the OSGSFs where the OSGs are stored.
    TVA describes the OSGSFs as robust structures that are closed with 
10 stacked precast concrete panels weighing approximately 17,237 
kilograms (38,000 pounds) each. The OSGSFs are located outside the 
Sequoyah protected area, but within the exclusion area and site 
boundary. Removal of the concrete panels is the only access point of 
sufficient size to remove an OSG and requires heavy lifting and rigging 
equipment that cannot be staged or utilized quickly. Removal of the 
concrete panels is an evolution that is easily observable over an 
extended period of time.
    TVA has requested a permanent exemption from the requirement in 10 
CFR 37.11(c)(2) to address a regulatory noncompliance that has resulted 
in the issuance of minor violations at the Sequoyah site.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 37.11(a), the Commission may, upon application 
of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant such 
exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in 10 CFR part 37 
as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger life or

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    The exemption would exempt the licensee from the requirement to

attempted theft, sabotage, or diversion of the radioactive waste that 
contains category 1 or category 2 quantities of radioactive material.
    After issuance of the final part 37 rule, the NRC issued 
Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 2014-001, ``Interim Guidance for 
Dispositioning 10 CFR part 37 Violations with Respect to Large 
Components or Robust Structures Containing Category 1 or Category 2 
Quantities of Material at Power Reactor Facilities Licensed Under 10 
CFR parts 50 and 52'' (ML14056A151), on March 13, 2014, to provide 
guidance to NRC staff for dispositioning violations associated with 10 
CFR part 37 with respect to large components containing category 1 and 
category 2 quantities of radioactive material stored in robust 
structures at power reactor facilities licensed under 10 CFR parts 50 
and 52. The EGM acknowledges that due to their size and weight, these 
large components are not easily moved without cranes, rigging, and 
heavy equipment. In addition, these large components are not easily 
concealed during loading or when they are in motion, and the amount of 
time required to steal or divert these large components is such that it 
is reasonable to expect that the licensee would detect these 
activities.
    TVA has a written 10 CFR part 37 security plan for Sequoyah that 
identifies the OSGs as large components and the OSGSFs as robust 
structures containing category 1 or category 2 quantities of 
radioactive material. The plan also identifies the security measures 
that are adequate to detect, assess, and respond to actual or attempted 
theft or diversion of stored materials from the OSGSFs. TVA provided a 
written analysis that considers the time needed to accomplish these 
activities given the proximity and mobility of the equipment available 
for the large components and robust structures supporting the 10 CFR 
part 37 security plan. TVA also provided a written analysis documenting 
that the measures for the protection of large components or robust 
structures containing category 1 or category 2 quantities of material 
do not decrease the effectiveness of the 10 CFR part 73 security plan.
    Because TVA has a security plan that contains measures to control 
access to the radioactive waste, assess and respond to unauthorized 
access, and notify and request an armed response by the LLEA, the NRC 
finds that the exemption will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is in the Public Interest

    TVA stated that the exemption would preclude the expenditure of 
resources that provide no additional security and protection for the 
OSGs. Granting of the exemption would also allow TVA to address a 
regulatory noncompliance and avoid future violations.
    As noted previously, the OSGs are large components that are stored 
in robust structures that would require the use of heavy lifting and 
rigging equipment that cannot be staged or utilized quickly. Requiring 
the use of a locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access 
control point is supplanted by the licensee's security plan which 
utilizes other means to detect unauthorized access, while the exemption 
would reduce the regulatory burden on the licensee and the NRC staff. 
Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that the exemption is in the public 
interest.

IV. Environmental Considerations

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, 51.32, and 51.35, an environmental 
assessment and finding of no significant impact regarding this 
exemption request was published in the Federal Register on June 27, 
2024 (89 FR 53667). Based upon the environmental assessment, the 
Commission has determined that issuance of this exemption will not have 
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.

V. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
37.11(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or 
property or the common defense and security, and is in the public 
interest.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC is issuing for public comment a DG in the NRC's 
``Regulatory Guide'' series. This series was developed to describe 
methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific 
parts of the agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff 
uses in evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to 
describe information that the staff needs in its review of applications 
for permits and licenses.
    The DG, entitled ``Acceptable ASME Section XI Inservice Inspection 
Code Cases for 10 CFR part 72,'' is temporarily identified by its task 
number, DG-3058 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24093A010).
    This DG-3058 is a proposed Revision 0 to a new RG 3.78 and provides 
the NRC staff and the industry with guidance using codes and standards 
for inservice inspection of confinement boundary components and aging 
management activities associated with the renewals of ISFSIs, general 
licensees, and CoC holders for spent fuel storage systems. This DG is 
endorsing the American Society of

[[Page 58081]]

Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code Case N-860, ``Inspection Requirements 
and Evaluation Standards for Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage and 
Transportation Containment Systems Section XI, Division 1; Section XI, 
Division 2,'' dated July 6, 2020.
    The staff is also issuing for public comment a draft regulatory 
analysis (ADAMS Accession No. ML24093A012). The staff develops a 
regulatory analysis to assess the value of issuing or revising a 
regulatory guide as well as alternative courses of action.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Proposed Rules'' section of 
the Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under 
chapter I of title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

III. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of this DG would not constitute backfitting as defined in 
10 CFR 72.62, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC Management 
Directive 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue 
Finality, and Information Requests'' (ADAMS Accession No. ML18093B087). 
That is, licensees would not be required to comply with the positions 
set forth in this proposed regulatory guide.

IV. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 50-302 and 72-1035; NRC-2024-0124]


Accelerated Decommissioning Partners Crystal River Unit 3, LLC; 
Crystal River Nuclear Power Station, Unit 3; Environmental Assessment 
and Finding of No Significant Impact

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a 
finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying environmental 
assessment (EA) regarding the NRC's consideration of a license 
amendment request by Accelerated Decommissioning Partners Crystal River 
Unit 3, LLC (ADP) to approve the License Termination Plan (LTP) for the 
Crystal River Nuclear Power Station, Unit 3 (CR3), located in Citrus 
County, Florida. If approved, the amendment would add a license 
condition to the ADP license reflecting the NRC's approval of its LTP 
and establishing criteria for determining when changes to the LTP 
require prior NRC approval. ADP would use the LTP to meet the 
requirements for terminating the license and releasing the site for 
unrestricted use. Based on the EA, the NRC staff has concluded that 
there will be no significant impacts to environmental resources from 
the requested license amendment, and therefore, a FONSI is appropriate.

DATES: The EA and FONSI referenced in this document are available on 
July 17, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of a license amendment request to 
approve the LTP for the CR3, located in Citrus County, Florida, as part 
of ADP's part 50 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities,'' 
Facility Operating License No. DPR-72. If granted, the license 
amendment would add a condition to ADP's license reflecting the NRC's 
approval of ADP's LTP and establishing criteria for determining when 
changes to the LTP require prior NRC approval. As required by 10 CFR 
part 51, ``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing 
and Related Regulatory Functions,'' the NRC prepared an EA. Based on 
the results of the EA, the NRC has determined not to prepare an 
environmental impact statement for the license amendment request and is 
issuing a FONSI.
    Construction of the CR3 began in 1968, and the NRC issued an 
operating license to Duke Energy Florida (DEF) in 1977. The CR3 began 
commercial operation in March 1977. The CR3 stopped operations in 2009 
and was officially retired on February 5, 2013.
    On December 2, 2013, DEF submitted a Post-Shutdown Decommissioning 
Activities Report (PSDAR) to NRC selecting SAFSTOR as the plant 
decommissioning strategy. SAFSTOR is a method of decommissioning in 
which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in a safe stable 
condition for a number of years until it is subsequently decontaminated 
and dismantled to levels that permit license termination. During 
SAFSTOR, a facility is left intact, but the fuel has been removed from 
the reactor vessel and radioactive liquids have been drained from 
systems and components and then processed. Radioactive decay occurs 
during SAFSTOR period, thus reducing the quantity of contaminated and 
radioactive material that must be disposed of during decontamination 
and dismantlement. In January 2018, DEF certified to the NRC that DEF 
had removed all spent fuel assemblies from the CR3 spent fuel pool and 
loaded the final storage cask used to store spent fuel at the CR3 
Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation.
    In 2020, the NRC approved the requested transfer of the CR3 from 
DEF to ADP to commence decontamination, dismantlement, and demolition. 
On October 1, 2020, ADP updated the PSDAR to change the plant 
decommissioning strategy from SAFSTOR to DECON, which is an option for 
reactor decommissioning in which the equipment, structures, and 
portions of a facility and site containing radioactive contaminants are 
removed or decontaminated to a level that permits termination of the 
license shortly after cessation of operations. ADP submitted the LTP on 
December 12, 2022, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(9), and submitted 
an updated LTP on March 29, 2024.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action is the review and subsequent approval, if 
appropriate, of a license amendment to ADP to approve the LTP for the 
CR3. If approved, the amendment would add a license condition to the 
ADP license reflecting the NRC's approval of the LTP and establishing 
criteria for determining when changes to the LTP require prior NRC 
approval. The proposed action is described in ADP's 2022 LTP 
application, as supplemented by the updated 2024 LTP, and responses to 
requests for additional information dated May 9, 2024.

Purpose and Need for the Proposed Action

    The purpose of and need for the proposed action is to allow 
completion of decommissioning of the CR3 site by ADP, termination of 
the CR3 operating license by the NRC, and subsequent release of the 
site for unrestricted use. The NRC regulation at 10 CFR 50.82 sets 
forth the process for the licensee to decommission its nuclear power 
plant, including submission of the LTP. The NRC will approve the LTP, 
provided that the LTP meets the criteria in 10 CFR 50.82(a)(10).

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff considered the potential impacts of the proposed 
action on land use; visual and scenic resources/aesthetics; 
climatology, meteorology, and air quality; noise; geology and soils; 
water resources; historic and cultural resources; ecological resources; 
socioeconomics; public and occupation health; transportation and 
traffic; environmental justice; and waste management. The 
Decommissioning Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) (NUREG-
0586, Supplement 1, Volume 1) generically addressed many of the 
potential environmental impacts of decommissioning at the CR3. During 
its review of the LTP, the NRC concluded that the impacts for most 
resource areas--onsite land use; water resources; air quality; ecology, 
not including threatened and endangered species or outside the 
operational area; socioeconomics; historic and cultural resources 
within the operational area; aesthetics; noise; and transportation--
were still bounded by the Decommissioning GEIS. Therefore, the NRC does 
not expect impacts associated with these issues beyond those discussed 
in the GEIS, which concluded that the impact level for these issues was 
SMALL.
    Although the Decommissioning GEIS did evaluate radioactive waste 
management, the NRC staff determined that the GEIS had underestimated 
the volume of low-level radioactive waste that the CR3 would produce. 
Consequently, the NRC staff determined the effects of the proposed 
action of radioactive waste management for CR3 on a site-specific 
basis.
    In the Decommissioning GEIS, the NRC staff concluded that it could 
not necessarily determine the environmental impacts of decommissioning 
generically for six environmental resource areas (offsite land use, 
threatened and endangered species, aquatic ecology beyond the 
operational area, terrestrial ecology beyond the operational area, 
environmental justice, and historic and cultural resources beyond the 
operational area). The Decommissioning GEIS determined that for these 
six resource areas a site-specific analysis would be required as was 
done in the CR3 EA. In addition, topics not included in the 
Decommissioning GEIS that the NRC staff evaluated in the CR3 EA include 
the affected environment, climate change, cumulative impacts, and 
nonradioactive waste management.
    In the CR3 EA, the NRC staff evaluated the potential environmental 
impacts on the six site-specific environmental resource areas as well 
as the four resource areas not evaluated in the Decommissioning GEIS 
and did not identify any significant impacts. For the proposed action 
there are no planned activities outside of the operational area, and 
ADP plans to use best management practices and obtain all necessary 
licenses from Federal or State agencies to limit potential impacts and 
protect surrounding lands. Therefore, the proposed action would result 
in no significant impacts and there would be no significant cumulative 
effects when added to the past, present, or reasonably foreseeable 
future actions at the CR3 site.

[[Page 58198]]

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered the 
``no-action'' alternative. Under the no-action alternative, the NRC 
would not approve the LTP or the license amendment request because 
regulatory requirements have not been met.
    If the NRC was unable to approve the LTP because the regulatory 
requirements were not met, ADP would need to take additional actions to 
prepare an LTP that meets the requirements in 10 CFR 50.82(a)(10). 
Under that scenario, ADP would resubmit the LTP, activities at the CR3 
would likely continue, and the environmental impacts would not change 
as a result of the additional time required for the LTP resubmission.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    On May 20, 2024, the NRC staff provided a copy of the draft EA to 
the Florida Department of Health for its review and comment. In a 
letter dated June 7, 2024, the State responded with no comments on the 
draft EA.
    NRC staff conducted National Historic Preservation Act consultation 
pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8(c), including submitting required notification 
to the Florida State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory 
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). The NRC staff solicited 
comments from the public on the historic and cultural resources 
sections of the draft EA and findings. Staff published the draft 
sections on the NRC website and electronically notified the four 
Federally recognized Indian Tribes with historic and ancestral ties to 
the project vicinity, the Florida SHPO, and members of the public who 
have indicated their interest in the CR3. No members of the public 
commented on the historic and cultural resources sections of the draft 
EA and findings. The NRC staff received a response from the Seminole 
Tribe of Florida indicating that the Tribe had no objections or other 
comments. The NRC staff did not receive a response from the other 
Indian Tribes it contacted. Staff made a determination of no historic 
properties affected and has received SHPO concurrence and no objections 
from other parties. The Florida SHPO responded on May 20, 2024, with 
its concurrence with NRC staff's determination. The ACHP responded on 
May 20, 2024, confirming receipt of NRC's notification pursuant to 36 
CFR 800.8(c).

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    Based on its review of the proposed license amendment request, in 
accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR part 51, the NRC staff has 
determined that issuing the requested amendment, if appropriate, 
amending ADP's DPR-72 license would not significantly affect the 
quality of human environment. No significant radiological or non-
radiological impacts are expected from the proposed action. Therefore, 
the NRC staff has determined that pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, 
``Determinations based on environmental assessment,'' preparation of an 
EIS is not required for the proposed action, and pursuant to 10 CFR 
51.32, ``Finding of no significant impact,'' a FONSI is appropriate. In 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.32(a)(4), this FONSI incorporates the EA set 
forth in this notice by reference.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    During the period from June 1, 2024, to June 30, 2024, the NRC 
granted two exemptions in response to requests submitted by the 
following licensees: TMI-2 Solutions; and Constellation Energy 
Generation, LLC.
    These exemptions temporarily allow the licensee to deviate from 
certain requirements of part 73 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,'' 
subpart T, ``Security Notifications, Reports, and Recordkeeping.'' In 
support of their exemption requests, the licensees agreed to effect 
site-specific administrative controls that maintain the approach to 
complying with 10 CFR part 73 in effect prior to the NRC's issuance of 
a final rule, ``Enhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and 
Security Event Notifications,'' which was published in the Federal 
Register on March 14, 2023, and became effective on April 13, 2023 (88 
FR 15864).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is amending its regulations in parts 50, 52, and 54 of 
title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). The NRC is making 
these amendments to clarify language and correct grammatical and 
typographical errors, punctuation, references, and terms.

10 CFR Parts 50 and 54

    Correct Grammatical Errors. This final rule revises Sec.  
50.10(e)(1)(iii) to remove periods and adjust capitalization to reflect 
that this paragraph contains a continuous list of items required for 
issuance of a limited work authorization.
    Remove Outdated Term. This final rule revises Sec.  50.30(d) to 
remove references to ``an amendment to an application for a license to 
construct and operate a production or utilization facility'' as this 
appears to be an outdated license application type (i.e., a forerunner 
to the current combined license).
    Correct Term. This final rule amends Sec.  50.33(j) and Sec.  
54.17(f) by removing the undefined term ``other defense information.'' 
The term dates to an Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) amendment of this 
section on January 19, 1956 (21 FR 355, 357) and was not changed with 
the promulgation of 10 CFR part 95 (45 FR 14476; March 5, 1980) after 
the establishment of the NRC and the 1975 reissuance of the former AEC 
regulations. This final rule replaces the outdated term with the term 
``classified National Security Information,'' for consistency with 
other use of this term in parts 50 and 54.
    Clarify Language and Correct Punctuation. This final rule revises 
the first sentence of Sec.  50.36b(b) to clarify the potential for 
removal of the authority to operate the reactor when a final, legally 
effective order to permanently cease operations comes into effect under 
Sec.  50.82(a)(1) or Sec.  52.110(a). This final rule also revises the 
second sentence to add a comma before the word ``which.''
    Correct Grammatical and Typographical Errors. This final rule 
revises the introductory text of Sec.  50.43(e) to replace the word 
``which'' with the word ``that,'' and to replace a period with a comma 
and adjust capitalization to eliminate two incomplete sentences.
    Clarify Language. This final rule revises Sec.  50.55(e)(2)(i) to 
clarify the scope of license holders that are subject to this 
regulation (i.e., the regulations are only applicable to holders of a 
construction permit, combined license, or a manufacturing license and 
not all licensees subject to the regulations in 10 CFR part 50). This 
final rule also clarifies the introductory text of paragraph 
(e)(3)(iii) and paragraph (e)(4)(ii) by adding ``or manufactured 
reactor'' because the Sec.  21.3 definition of ``basic component'' does 
not appear to be broad enough to include the term. Finally, this final 
rule updates the initial notification requirements in paragraph 
(e)(5)(i) to reflect that emails are also a permissible initial 
notification method in addition to facsimile and phone notification 
options.
    This final rule amends Sec.  50.59(c)(1)(i) by replacing the phrase 
``A change'' with ``An amendment'' to avoid using the defined term 
``change'' that is used elsewhere in this section.
    Correct References and Grammatical Error. This final rule revises 
Sec.  50.82(a) by adding the actual effective date of the 
Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Reactors final rule in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iii), removing the incorrect reference to Sec.  50.2 in the 
introductory text to paragraph (a)(6), and correcting the placement of 
the semicolon at the end of paragraph (a)(8)(i)(B).
    Correct Reference. This final rule amends Sec.  50.100 to change 
the reference to Sec.  50.42(a) to instead reference Sec.  50.42. The 
provisions in Sec.  50.42(a) were moved to Sec.  50.42 by 73 FR 44619, 
July 31, 2008 and the reference to Sec.  50.42(a) is no longer valid.

[[Page 57718]]

    Correct Typographical Error. This final rule amends Sec.  
50.109(a)(4) by correcting ``appropriated documented evaluation'' to 
read ``appropriate documented evaluation.''

10 CFR Parts 50 and 52

    Clarify Language and Correct Punctuation. This final rule amends 
Sec.  50.37 by adding the word ``or'' and commas, and Sec.  52.54(c) by 
adding commas, to correct drafting errors and ensure parallel language. 
The preamble for the rulemaking that modified the parallel language in 
10 CFR parts 50 and 52, Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for 
Nuclear Power Plants, provides a discussion on the intended language 
for these sections (72 FR 49352; August 28, 2007).

10 CFR Part 52

    Clarify Language. This final rule amends Sec.  52.26(b) by adding 
the words ``early site'' to the phrase ``if a timely application for 
renewal of the permit has been docketed'' to clarify that the term 
``permit'' refers to the early site permit and not to the construction 
permit for which an application was submitted.
    This final rule revises the introductory text of Sec.  52.31(a) to 
clarify that it is a criterion for renewal and Sec.  52.31(b) to 
reflect that the provisions in Sec.  52.31(a) are applicable to the 
Commission and not to the applicant for renewal of an early site 
permit.
    This final rule amends Sec.  52.39(c) by removing the word 
``should'' to improve the clarity of the paragraph and Sec.  52.39(e) 
by replacing the word ``including'' with the word ``or'' to clarify the 
relationship between the early site permit and the site safety analysis 
report.
    Correct Reference. This final rule revises the reference in Sec.  
52.91(b) to clarify that the sole activities permitted under paragraph 
(a) of this section are the submittal of an application for a limited 
work authorization under Sec.  50.10.
    Correct Grammatical Error. This final rule amends Sec.  
52.103(b)(2) by removing the word ``that,'' which is already included 
in the introductory text of paragraph (b).
    Remove References and Correct Punctuation. This final rule amends 
Sec.  52.110(e) to remove the incorrect reference to Sec.  50.2 and the 
introductory text of Sec.  52.110(f) to remove the incorrect reference 
to Sec.  52.1, since neither reference contains a definition for 
``decommissioning activities.'' This final rule also amends Sec.  
52.110(h)(1)(ii) to correct the placement of the semicolon.
    Correct Punctuation. This final rule amends Sec.  52.158(a)(1)(i) 
to replace the semicolon after ``manufacturing license'' with a comma.
    Correct Term. This final rule amends Sec.  52.177(d) by removing 
the term ``permit'' and adding the term ``license'' to reflect that a 
manufacturing license is considered a license in accordance with the 
definitions in Sec.  52.1.

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    Under section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 
U.S.C.553(b)), an agency may waive publication in the Federal Register 
of a notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity for comment 
requirements if it finds, for good cause, that it is impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. As authorized by 5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), the NRC finds good cause to waive notice and 
opportunity for comment on these amendments, because notice and 
opportunity for comment is unnecessary. The amendments will have no 
substantive impact and are of a minor and administrative nature dealing 
with corrections to certain CFR sections or are related only to 
management, organization, procedure, and practice. Specifically, the 
revisions clarify language and correct grammatical and typographical 
errors, punctuation, references, and terms. The Commission is 
exercising its authority under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) to publish these 
amendments as a final rule. The amendments are effective August 15, 
2024. These amendments do not require action by any person or entity 
regulated by the NRC and do not change the substantive responsibilities 
of any person or entity regulated by the NRC.

III. Backfitting and Issue Finality

    The NRC has determined that the corrections in this final rule 
would not constitute backfitting as defined in Sec.  50.109, 
``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC Management Directive (MD) 8.4, 
``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and 
Information Requests.'' These corrections also would not constitute 
forward fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 8.4 or 
affect the issue finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52. 
The amendments are non-substantive in nature, including clarifying 
language and correcting grammatical and typographical errors, 
punctuation, references, and terms. They impose no new requirements and 
make no substantive changes to the regulations. The corrections do not 
involve any provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 
chapter I, or that would be inconsistent with the issue finality 
provisions in 10 CFR part 52. For these reasons, the issuance of this 
final rule would not constitute backfitting or be inconsistent with any 
of the issue finality provisions in 10 CFR part 52. Therefore, the NRC 
has not prepared any additional documentation for this correction 
rulemaking addressing backfitting or issue finality.

IV. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885).

V. National Environmental Policy Act

    The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action 
described in Sec.  51.22(c)(2), which categorically excludes from 
environmental review rules that are corrective or of a minor, nonpolicy 
nature and do not substantially modify existing regulations. Therefore, 
neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental 
assessment has been prepared for this rule.

VI. Paperwork Reduction Act

    This final rule does not contain a collection of information as 
defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) 
and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995.

VII. Congressional Review Act

    This final rule is not a rule as defined in the Congressional 
Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808).

which is of a type described in Sec.  50.21(b)(2) or (3) or Sec.  50.22 
or is a testing facility, may include conditions to protect the 
environment during operation and decommissioning. These conditions are 
to be set out in an attachment to the license, which is incorporated in 
and made a part of the license. These conditions will be derived from 
information contained in the environmental report or the supplement to 
the environmental report submitted pursuant to Sec. Sec.  51.50 and 
51.53 of this chapter as analyzed and evaluated in the NRC record of

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION


Request for Qualified Candidates for Appointment to the Advisory 
Committee on Reactor Safeguards

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Request for resumes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) seeks qualified 
candidates for appointment to the Advisory Committee on Reactor 
Safeguards (ACRS or Committee).

ADDRESSES: Submit resumes to Sandra Walker, ACRS, Mail Stop: T2B50, 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or email 
[email protected].

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The ACRS is a part-time advisory group, 
which is statutorily mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended. The ACRS provides independent expert advice on matters related 
to the safety of existing and proposed nuclear reactor facilities and 
on the adequacy of proposed reactor safety standards. Of primary 
importance are the safety issues associated with the operation of 
commercial nuclear power plants in the United States and related 
regulatory initiatives, including risk-informed and performance-based 
regulation, license renewals, enhanced burnup for the operating reactor 
fleet, and, importantly,

[[Page 57947]]

new licensing applications for non-light water reactors.
    An increased emphasis is being given to safety issues associated 
with new light water and non-light water reactor designs and 
technologies, including topics related to: neutronics and reactor 
kinetics analyses, thermal-hydraulic phenomena, passive and inherently 
safe design features, and integrated reactor core and systems 
performance; nuclear fuels and fuel management, chemistry, and 
materials; structural and seismic design and engineering; radiation 
protection, shielding, and health physics; probabilistic risk analysis 
and assessment; application of digital instrumentation and control 
systems; and international codes and industrial standards used in 
multinational and domestic nuclear design certifications and reviews.
    In addition, the ACRS may be requested to provide advice on 
radiation protection, radioactive waste management, and geosciences in 
the agency's licensing reviews for fuel fabrication and enrichment 
facilities, and for waste disposal facilities. The ACRS also has some 
involvement in security matters related to the integration of safety 
and security of commercial reactors and facilities. For additional 
information about the ACRS, see the NRC website at: https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/advisory/acrs.html.
    Criteria used to evaluate candidates include education and 
experience, demonstrated skills in nuclear reactor safety matters, the 
ability to solve complex technical problems, and the ability to work 
collegially on a board, panel, or committee. The Commission, in 
selecting its ACRS members, also considers the need for specific 
expertise to accomplish the work expected to be before the Committee. 
ACRS members are appointed for four-year terms with no term limits. The 
Commission looks to fill two vacancies as a result of this request. 
Candidates are desired that have broad, extensive experience in nuclear 
safety, such as multiple areas of current emphasis (listed previously) 
or multi-disciplinary expertise in similar fields of nuclear reactor 
and nuclear fuel cycle safety. Candidates with broad nuclear safety 
experience in industry, academia, laboratory, or regulatory 
backgrounds, or work between those environments, are encouraged to 
apply. The candidates should also have approximately 20 years of 
education and experience and a distinguished record of achievement in 
multiple areas of nuclear science and technology, or related 
engineering disciplines. Candidates with pertinent graduate level 
education will be given additional consideration, and candidates with 
relevant experience and a distinguished record who do not quite meet 
the 20-year threshold are also encouraged to apply.
    Consistent with the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act, the Commission seeks candidates with diverse backgrounds, so that 
the membership on the Committee is fairly balanced in terms of the 
points of view represented and functions to be performed by the 
Committee. Candidates will undergo a thorough security background check 
to obtain the security clearance that is mandatory for all ACRS 
members. The security background check will involve the completion and 
submission of paperwork to the NRC. Candidates for ACRS appointment may 
be involved in or have financial interests related to NRC-regulated 
aspects of the nuclear industry. However, because conflict-of-interest 
considerations may restrict the participation of a candidate in ACRS 
activities, the degree and nature of any such restriction on an 
individual's activities as a member will be considered in the selection 
process. Each qualified candidate's financial interests must be 
reconciled with applicable Federal and NRC rules and regulations prior 
to final appointment. This might require divestiture of securities or 
discontinuance of certain contracts or grants. Information regarding 
these restrictions will be provided upon request. As a part of the Stop 
Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, which bans insider 
trading by members of Congress, their staff, and other high-level 
federal employees, candidates for appointment will be required to 
disclose additional financial transactions.
    A resume describing the educational and professional background of 
each candidate, including any special accomplishments, publications, 
and professional references should be provided. Candidates should 
provide their current address, telephone number, and email address. All 
candidates will receive careful consideration. The NRC does not 
discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex 
(including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, political 
affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic 
information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, 
parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor. 
Candidates must be citizens of the United States and be able to devote 
approximately 100 days per year to Committee business, but may not be 
compensated for more than 130 calendar days. Appointees may be able to 
attend some Committee meetings virtually. Resumes will be accepted 
until October 15, 2024.

    Dated: July 11, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

state that the NRC does not routinely edit comment submissions to 
remove such information before making the comment submissions available 
to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC is issuing for public comment two related DGs in the NRC's 
``Regulatory Guide'' series, namely DG-1290 and DG-1417. This series 
was developed to describe methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff 
for implementing specific parts of the agency's regulations, to explain 
techniques that the staff uses in evaluating specific issues or 
postulated events, and to describe information that the staff needs in 
its review of applications for permits and licenses.
    DG-1290 was previously released for public comment on February 23, 
2022, as announced in the Federal Register (87 FR 10260). The public 
comment period ended on April 11, 2022. That version of DG-1290 can be 
found in ADAMS under Accession No. ML19289E561 and the response to 
public comments can be found at ADAMS Accession No. ML23320A026. DG-
1290, Revision 1 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23320A025) is being issued for 
a second round of comments due to changes reflecting public comments 
and proposed referencing of a complementary new guide, DG-1417 (RG 
1.256, Revision 0) ``Guidance for Assessment of Flooding Hazards Due to 
Water Control Structure Failures and Incidents.'' DG-1417 will be 
released for comment in conjunction with DG-1290, Revision 1.
    DG-1417 is a proposed new RG, RG 1.256, of the same name, and is 
temporarily identified by its task number, DG-1417 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML22278A110). It was developed to provide guidance to applicants for 
new NPPs on acceptable methods for evaluating design-basis flooding 
hazards due to failure or other incidents at man-made water control 
structures including, but not limited to, dams and levees. If 
finalized, RG 1.256 would formally incorporate interim staff guidance 
(ISG) ``Guidance for Assessment of Flooding Hazards Due to Dam 
Failure'' (JLD-ISG-2013-01) (ADAMS Accession No. ML13151A153) into 
NRC's regulatory guidance framework. ISGs are meant to be withdrawn 
after their immediate purpose has been fulfilled or integrated formally 
into the NRC's regulatory guidance framework. If DG-1417 is finalized 
as RG 1.256, JLD-ISG-2013-01 will be withdrawn. The staff is also 
issuing for public comment a draft regulatory analysis for DG-1417 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML22278A111). The staff developed the regulatory 
analysis to assess the value of issuing or revising a RG, as well as 
alternative courses of action. A regulatory analysis for DG-1290 was 
released for comment on February 23, 2022, and although no comments 
were received it is available for comment and can be found in ADAMS 
under Accession No. ML12121A020.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Proposed Rules'' section of 
the Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under 
chapter I of title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

[[Page 57374]]

III. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    If finalized, the NRC staff may use RG 1.256 as a reference in its 
regulatory processes, such as licensing, inspection, or enforcement. 
However, the NRC staff does not intend to use the proposed guidance in 
RG 1.256 to support NRC staff actions in a manner that would constitute 
backfitting as that term is defined in 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' 
and as described in NRC Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of 
Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information 
Requests,'' (ADAMS Accession No. ML18093B087); nor does the NRC staff 
intend to use the proposed guidance to affect the issue finality of an 
approval under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and 
Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants.'' The staff also does not intend to 
use the proposed guidance to support NRC staff actions in a manner that 
constitutes forward fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 
8.4. If a licensee believes that the NRC is using this proposed RG in a 
manner inconsistent with the discussion in this Implementation section, 
then the licensee may file a backfitting or forward fitting appeal with 
the NRC in accordance with the process in MD 8.4.

IV. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

10 CFR Part 72

[NRC-2024-0096]
RIN 3150-AL17


List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Holtec International 
HI-STORM FW System, Certificate of Compliance No. 1032, Amendment No. 7

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Direct final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its 
spent fuel storage regulations by revising the Holtec International HI-
STORM Flood/Wind Multi-purpose Canister Storage System listing within 
the ``List of approved spent fuel storage casks'' to include Amendment 
No. 7 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1032. Amendment No. 7 revises 
the certificate of compliance to add a new overpack, add new multi-
purpose canisters MPC-44 and MPC-37P, and add new fuel type 10x10J to 
approved content. Amendment No. 7 also incorporates other technical 
changes and several editorial changes.

DATES: This direct final rule is effective September 25, 2024, unless 
significant adverse comments are received by August 12, 2024. If this 
direct final rule is withdrawn as a result of such comments, timely 
notice of the withdrawal will be published in the Federal Register. 
Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical 
to do so, but the NRC is able to ensure consideration only for comments 
received on or before this date. Comments received on this direct final 
rule will also be considered to be comments on a companion proposed 
rule published in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the 
Federal Register.

to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    This rule is limited to the changes contained in Amendment No. 7 to 
Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1032 and does not include other 
aspects of the HI-STORM Flood/Wind Multi-purpose Canister Storage 
System (HI-STORM FW System) design. The NRC is using the ``direct final 
rule procedure'' to issue this amendment because it represents a 
limited and routine change to an existing CoC that is expected to be 
non-controversial. Adequate protection of public health and safety 
continues to be reasonably assured. The amendment to the rule will 
become effective on September 25, 2024. However, if the NRC receives 
any significant adverse comment on this direct final rule by August 12, 
2024, then the NRC will publish a document that withdraws this action 
and will subsequently address the comments received in a final rule as 
a response to the companion proposed rule published in the Proposed 
Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register or as otherwise 
appropriate. In general, absent significant modifications to the 
proposed revisions requiring republication, the NRC will not initiate a 
second comment period on this action.
    A significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and significant if:
    (1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient 
to require a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For 
example, a substantive response is required when:
    (a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its 
position or conduct additional analysis;
    (b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response to clarify or complete the record; or
    (c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously 
addressed or considered by the NRC.
    (2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and 
it is apparent that the rule would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without incorporation of the change or addition.
    (3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than 
editorial) to the rule, CoC, or technical specifications.

III. Background

    Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
requires that ``[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy] shall 
establish a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear 
power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more 
technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, 
approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional 
site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section 133 of the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act states, in part, that ``[t]he Commission shall, by 
rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved 
by the Commission under Section 219(a) [sic: 218(a)] for use at the 
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''
    To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks under a general license by 
publishing a final rule that added a new subpart K in part 72 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 
29181; July 18, 1990). This rule also established a new subpart L in 10 
CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' which 
contains procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of spent 
fuel storage cask designs. The NRC subsequently issued a final rule on 
June 8, 2011 (76 FR 33121), that approved the Holtec International HI-
STORM FW System design and added it to the list of NRC-approved cask 
designs in Sec.  72.214 as Certificate of Compliance No. 1032.

IV. Discussion of Changes

    On May 6, 2021, Holtec International submitted a request to the NRC 
to amend Certificate of Compliance No. 1032. Holtec International 
supplemented its request on October 15, 2021; February 17, 2022; July 
11, 2022; July 13, 2022; July 29, 2022; September 15, 2022; October 3, 
2022; December 1, 2022; January 6, 2023; May 8, 2023; June 30, 2023; 
July 11, 2023; August 15, 2023; November 17, 2023; February 16, 2024; 
and April 8, 2024. Amendment No. 7 revises the CoC as follows:
    1. Adds a new unventilated high density (UVH) overpack, HI-STORM 
100 UVH, which includes high density concrete for shielding. The UVH is 
to be used with MPC-37, MPC-89, and the new MPC-44.
    2. Modifies vent and drain penetrations to include the option of a 
second port cover plate.
    3. Allows automated equipment to perform leak test of the MPC 
materials and welds in the fabrication shop.
    4. Changes the hydrostatic pressure test of the MPC acceptance 
criteria to be examination for leakage only and removes post 
hydrostatic test liquid penetrant and magnetic particle examination.
    5. Includes the ability to use computational fluid dynamics 
analysis to evaluate site-specific fire accident scenarios.
    6. Uses updated methodology for tornado missile stability 
calculations for freestanding HI-STORMs and HI-TRACs (transfer casks) 
and clarifies the weights to be used for varying heights of HI-TRACs.
    7. Adds the new MPC-44, with continuous basket shim (CBS) and to 
hold 44 pressurized-water reactor fuel assemblies of certain 14x14 fuel 
class. It is to be used with HI-STORM FW System Version E and UVH 
overpacks.
    8. Adds the new MPC-37P, with CBS and to hold 37 pressurized-water 
reactor fuel assemblies of certain 15x15 fuel class. It is to be used 
with Version E overpack.
    9. Adds HI-DRIP ancillary system, which is an optional ancillary 
system

[[Page 57066]]

designed to prevent water within the MPC while loaded in the HI-TRAC 
from boiling during loading and unloading operations.
    10. Includes the ability to use computational fluid dynamics 
analysis to evaluate site-specific burial-under-debris accident 
scenarios.
    11. Includes the ability to use water without glycol in the HI-TRAC 
water jacket during transfer operations below 32 [deg]F based on the 
site specific MPC total heat loads.
    12. Adds new 10x10J fuel type to approved content in the HI-STORM 
FW System.
    13. Updates bounding fuel variables for 8x8F and 11x11A boiling-
water reactor fuel types in CoC appendix B.
    14. Adopts a stress-based structural design criterion.
    15. Establishes specific criteria on allowable interference due to 
differential thermal expansion.
    This amendment also makes the following editorial changes:
    1. Revises the description of the HI-STORM FW System in the CoC to 
clearly indicate that only the portions of the components that come 
into contact with the pool water need to be made of stainless steel or 
aluminum. This change was previously approved in HI-STORM FW System 
Amendment No. 8.
    2. Revises the statements in final safety analysis report (FSAR) 
Section 3.2 related to center of gravity eccentricities in the 
evaluation of lifting devices.
    3. Revises the FSAR by deleting Appendices 3.A to 3.C and adding 
references to calculation packages [3.4.13] and [3.4.15], where 
applicable.
    4. Revises CoC Appendix B Section 2.5 to clarify that the equation 
burn up and cooling time qualification requirements only apply to 
specific alternative loading patterns.
    5. Revises the FSAR by adding discussions related to short-term 
operations in the event of environmental phenomena to provide clarity 
and guidance on required site-specific analyses.
    6. Revises the FSAR by adding discussions related to site-specific 
analyses and adds references to a series of analysis methodologies for 
standardization.
    The changes to the aforementioned documents are identified with 
revisions bars in the margin of each document.
    In a final rule effective July 14, 2020 (85 FR 43419), the NRC 
approved Holtec International HI-STORM FW System Certificate of 
Compliance No. 1032, Amendment No. 4 but did not include the model 
number. The NRC is correcting the list of model numbers to include MPC-
32ML.
    As documented in the preliminary safety evaluation report, the NRC 
performed a safety evaluation of the proposed CoC amendment request. 
The NRC determined that this amendment does not reflect a significant 
change in design or fabrication of the cask. Specifically, the NRC 
determined that the design of the cask would continue to maintain 
confinement, shielding, and criticality control in the event of each 
evaluated accident condition. In addition, any resulting occupational 
exposure or offsite dose rates from the implementation of Amendment No. 
7 would remain well within the limits specified by 10 CFR part 20, 
``Standards for Protection Against Radiation.'' Thus, the NRC found 
there will be no significant change in the types or amounts of any 
effluent released, no significant increase in the individual or 
cumulative radiation exposure, and no significant increase in the 
potential for or consequences from radiological accidents.
    The NRC determined that the amended HI-STORM FW System cask design, 
when used under the conditions specified in the CoC, the technical 
specifications, and the NRC's regulations, will meet the requirements 
of 10 CFR part 72; therefore, adequate protection of public health and 
safety will continue to be reasonably assured. When this direct final 
rule becomes effective, persons who hold a general license under Sec.  
72.210 may, consistent with the license conditions under Sec.  72.212, 
load spent nuclear fuel into HI-STORM FW System casks that meet the 
criteria of Amendment No. 7 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1032.

V. Voluntary Consensus Standards

    The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Pub. 
L. 104-113) requires that Federal agencies use technical standards that 
are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies unless 
the use of such a standard is inconsistent with applicable law or 
otherwise impractical. In this direct final rule, the NRC revises the 
HI-STORM FW System design listed in Sec.  72.214, ``List of approved 
spent fuel storage casks.'' This action does not constitute the 
establishment of a standard that contains generally applicable 
requirements.

VI. Agreement State Compatibility

    Under the ``Agreement State Program Policy Statement'' approved by 
the Commission on October 2, 2017, and published in the Federal 
Register on October 18, 2017 (82 FR 48535), this rule is classified as 
Compatibility Category NRC--Areas of Exclusive NRC Regulatory 
Authority. The NRC program elements in this category are those that 
relate directly to areas of regulation reserved to the NRC by the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the provisions of 10 CFR 
chapter I. Therefore, compatibility is not required for program 
elements in this category.

VII. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885).

VIII. Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact

    Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 
and the NRC's regulations in 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection 
Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions,'' 
the NRC has determined that this direct final rule, if adopted, would 
not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of 
the human environment and, therefore, an environmental impact statement 
is not required. The NRC has made a finding of no significant impact on 
the basis of this environmental assessment.

A. The Action

    The action is to amend Sec.  72.214 to revise the Holtec 
International HI-STORM FW System listing within the ``List of approved 
spent fuel storage casks'' to include Amendment No. 7 to Certificate of 
Compliance No. 1032.

B. The Need for the Action

    This direct final rule amends the CoC for the Holtec International 
HI-STORM FW System design within the list of approved spent fuel 
storage casks to allow power reactor licensees to store spent fuel at 
reactor sites in casks with the approved modifications under a general 
license. Specifically, Amendment No. 7 revises the CoC to add a new 
unventilated high density (UVH) overpack, modify vent and drain 
penetrations, allow automated equipment to perform leak test, change 
the hydrostatic pressure test acceptance criteria, include the ability 
to use computational fluid dynamics analysis to evaluate site-specific 
fire accident scenario, use updated methodology for tornado missile 
stability calculations,

[[Page 57067]]

add the new MPC-44, add the new MPC-37P, add HI-DRIP ancillary system, 
include the ability to use computational fluid dynamics analysis to 
evaluate site-specific burial-under-debris accident scenario, include 
the ability to use water without glycol in the HI-TRAC water jacket, 
add new 10x10J fuel type to approved content, update bounding fuel 
variables for specific fuel types, adopt a stress-based structural 
design criterion, establish specific criteria on allowable interference 
due to differential thermal expansion, and other editorial changes.

C. Environmental Impacts of the Action

    On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 
CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general 
license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The potential 
environmental impact of using NRC-approved storage casks was analyzed 
in the environmental assessment for the 1990 final rule. The 
environmental assessment for this Amendment No. 7 tiers off of the 
environmental assessment for the July 18, 1990, final rule. Tiering on 
past environmental assessments is a standard process under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
    The Holtec International HI-STORM FW System is designed to mitigate 
the effects of design basis accidents that could occur during storage. 
Design basis accidents account for human-induced events and the most 
severe natural phenomena reported for the site and surrounding area. 
Postulated accidents analyzed for an independent spent fuel storage 
installation, the type of facility at which a holder of a power reactor 
operating license would store spent fuel in casks in accordance with 10 
CFR part 72, can include tornado winds and tornado-generated missiles, 
a design basis earthquake, a design basis flood, an accidental cask 
drop, lightning effects, fire, explosions, and other incidents.
    This amendment does not reflect a significant change in design or 
fabrication of the cask. Because there are no significant design or 
process changes, any resulting occupational exposure or offsite dose 
rates from the implementation of Amendment No. 7 would remain well 
within the 10 CFR part 20 limits. The NRC has also determined that the 
design of the cask as modified by this rule would maintain confinement, 
shielding, and criticality control in the event of an accident. 
Therefore, the proposed changes will not result in any radiological or 
non-radiological environmental impacts that significantly differ from 
the environmental impacts evaluated in the environmental assessment 
supporting the July 18, 1990, final rule. There will be no significant 
change in the types or significant revisions in the amounts of any 
effluent released, no significant increase in the individual or 
cumulative radiation exposures, and no significant increase in the 
potential for, or consequences from, radiological accidents. The NRC 
documented its safety findings in the preliminary safety evaluation 
report.

D. Alternative to the Action

    The alternative to this action is to deny approval of Amendment No. 
7 and not issue the direct final rule. Consequently, any 10 CFR part 72 
general licensee that seeks to load spent nuclear fuel into a Holtec 
International HI-STORM FW System in accordance with the changes 
described in proposed Amendment No. 7 would have to request an 
exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212 and 72.214. Under 
this alternative, interested licensees would have to prepare, and the 
NRC would have to review, a separate exemption request, thereby 
increasing the administrative burden upon the NRC and the costs to each 
licensee. The environmental impacts would be the same as the proposed 
action.

E. Alternative Use of Resources

    Approval of Amendment No. 7 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1032 
would result in no irreversible commitment of resources.

F. Agencies and Persons Contacted

    No agencies or persons outside the NRC were contacted in connection 
with the preparation of this environmental assessment.

G. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the action have been reviewed under 
the requirements in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as 
amended, and the NRC's regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, 
``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions.'' Based on the foregoing environmental 
assessment, the NRC concludes that this direct final rule, ``List of 
Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Holtec International HI-STORM FW 
System Certificate of Compliance No. 1032, Amendment No. 7,'' will not 
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, the NRC 
has determined that an environmental impact statement is not necessary 
for this direct final rule.

IX. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement

    This direct final rule does not contain any new or amended 
collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing collections of information were 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150-
0132.

Public Protection Notification

    The NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a request for information or an information collection 
requirement unless the requesting document displays a currently valid 
Office of Management and Budget control number.

X. Regulatory Flexibility Certification

    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the 
NRC certifies that this direct final rule will not, if issued, have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
This direct final rule affects only nuclear power plant licensees and 
Holtec International. These entities do not fall within the scope of 
the definition of small entities set forth in the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act or the size standards established by the NRC (Sec.  
2.810).

XI. Regulatory Analysis

    On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 
CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent nuclear fuel under a 
general license in cask designs approved by the NRC. Any nuclear power 
reactor licensee can use NRC-approved cask designs to store spent 
nuclear fuel if (1) it notifies the NRC in advance; (2) the spent fuel 
is stored under the conditions specified in the cask's CoC; and (3) the 
conditions of the general license are met. A list of NRC-approved cask 
designs is contained in Sec.  72.214. On June 8, 2011 (76 FR 33121), 
the NRC issued an amendment to 10 CFR part 72 that approved the HI-
STORM FW System by adding it to the list of NRC-approved cask designs 
in Sec.  72.214.

request to amend the HI-STORM FW

[[Page 57068]]

System as described in Section IV, ``Discussion of Changes,'' of this 
document.
    The alternative to this action is to withhold approval of Amendment 
No. 7 and to require any 10 CFR part 72 general licensee seeking to 
load spent nuclear fuel into the Holtec International HI-STORM FW 
System under the changes described in Amendment No. 7 to request an 
exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212 and 72.214. Under 
this alternative, each interested 10 CFR part 72 licensee would have to 
prepare, and the NRC would have to review, a separate exemption 
request, thereby increasing the administrative burden upon the NRC and 
the costs to each licensee.
    Approval of this direct final rule is consistent with previous NRC 
actions. Further, as documented in the preliminary safety evaluation 
report and environmental assessment, this direct final rule will have 
no adverse effect on public health and safety or the environment. This 
direct final rule has no significant identifiable impact or benefit on 
other government agencies. Based on this regulatory analysis, the NRC 
concludes that the requirements of this direct final rule are 
commensurate with the NRC's responsibilities for public health and 
safety and the common defense and security. No other available 
alternative is believed to be as satisfactory; therefore, this action 
is recommended.

XII. Backfitting and Issue Finality

    The NRC has determined that the backfit rule (Sec.  72.62) does not 
apply to this direct final rule. Therefore, a backfit analysis is not 
required. This direct final rule revises Certificate of Compliance No. 
1032 for the Holtec International HI-STORM FW System as currently 
listed in Sec.  72.214. The revision consists of the changes in 
Amendment No. 7 previously described, as set forth in the revised CoC 
and technical specifications.
    Amendment No. 7 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1032 for the 
Holtec International HI-STORM FW System was initiated by Holtec 
International and was not submitted in response to new NRC 
requirements, or an NRC request for amendment. Amendment No. 7 applies 
only to new casks fabricated and used under Amendment No. 7. These 
changes do not affect existing users of the Holtec International HI-
STORM FW System and the current Amendment Nos. 6 and 8 continue to be 
effective for existing users. While current users of this storage 
system may comply with the new requirements in Amendment No. 7, this 
would be a voluntary decision on the part of current users.
    For these reasons, Amendment No. 7 to Certificate of Compliance No. 
1032 does not constitute backfitting under Sec.  72.62 or Sec.  
50.109(a)(1), or otherwise represent an inconsistency with the issue 
finality provisions applicable to combined licenses in 10 CFR part 52. 
Accordingly, the NRC has not prepared a backfit analysis for this 
rulemaking.

XIII. Congressional Review Act

    This direct final rule is not a rule as defined in the 
Congressional Review Act.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

10 CFR Part 72

[NRC-2024-0096]
RIN 3150-AL17


List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Holtec International 
HI-STORM FW System, Certificate of Compliance No. 1032, Amendment No. 7

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to 
amend its spent fuel regulations by revising the Holtec International 
HI-STORM Flood/Wind Multi-purpose Canister Storage System listing 
within the ``List of approved spent fuel storage casks'' to include 
Amendment No. 7 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1032. Amendment No. 7 
revises the certificate of compliance to add a new overpack, add new 
multi-purpose canisters MPC-44 and MPC-37P, and add new fuel type 
10x10J to approved content. Amendment No. 7 also incorporates other 
technical changes and several editorial changes.

DATES: Submit comments by August 12, 2024. Comments received after this 
date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the NRC is 
able to ensure consideration only for comments received on or before 
this date.

for submission to the NRC, then you should inform those persons not to 
include identifying or contact information that they do not want to be 
publicly disclosed in their comment submission. Your request should 
state that the NRC does not routinely edit comment submissions to 
remove such information before making the comment submissions available 
to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    Because the NRC considers this action to be non-controversial, the 
NRC is publishing this proposed rule concurrently with a direct final 
rule in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal 
Register. The direct final rule will become effective on September 25, 
2024. However, if the NRC receives any significant adverse comment by 
August 12, 2024, then the NRC will publish a document that withdraws 
the direct final rule. If the direct final rule is withdrawn, the NRC 
will address the comments in a subsequent final rule. In general, 
absent significant modifications to the proposed revisions requiring 
republication, the NRC will not initiate a second comment period on 
this action in the event the direct final rule is withdrawn.

[[Page 57096]]

    A significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and significant if:
    (1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient 
to require a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For 
example, a substantive response is required when:
    (a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its 
position or conduct additional analysis;
    (b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response to clarify or complete the record; or
    (c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously 
addressed or considered by the NRC.
    (2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and 
it is apparent that the rule would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without incorporation of the change or addition.
    (3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than 
editorial) to the rule.
    For a more detailed discussion of the proposed rule changes and 
associated analyses, see the direct final rule published in the Rules 
and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register.

III. Background

    Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
requires that ``[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy] shall 
establish a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear 
power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more 
technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, 
approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional 
site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section 133 of the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act states, in part, that ``[t]he Commission shall, by 
rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved 
by the Commission under Section 219(a) [sic: 218(a)] for use at the 
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''
    To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks under a general license by 
publishing a final rule that added a new subpart K in part 72 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 
29181; July 18, 1990). This rule also established a new subpart L in 10 
CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' which 
contains procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of spent 
fuel storage cask designs. The NRC subsequently issued a final rule on 
June 8, 2011 (76 FR 33121), that approved the Holtec International HI-
STORM Flood/Wind Multi-purpose Canister Storage System design and added 
it to the list of NRC-approved cask designs in Sec.  72.214 as 
Certificate of Compliance No. 1032.

IV. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885). The NRC requests comment on the proposed rule with respect to 
clarity and effectiveness of the language used.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2024-0119]


Monthly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating 
Licenses and Combined Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards 
Considerations

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Monthly notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 189a.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is 
publishing this regular monthly notice. The Act requires the Commission 
to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, 
and grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately 
effective any amendment to an operating license or combined license, as 
applicable, upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment 
involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC), notwithstanding 
the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any 
person.

DATES: Comments must be filed by August 8, 2024. A request for a 
hearing or petitions for leave to intervene must be filed by September 
9, 2024. This monthly notice includes all amendments issued, or 
proposed to be issued, from May 24, 2024, to June 20, 2024. The last 
monthly notice was published on June 11, 2024.

remove such information before making the comment submissions available 
to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses and Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination

    For the facility-specific amendment requests shown in this notice, 
the Commission finds that the licensees' analyses provided, consistent 
with section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) ``Notice for public comment; State consultation,'' are sufficient 
to support the proposed determinations that these amendment requests 
involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, 
operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments 
would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves NSHC. In addition, the Commission may issue any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period 
if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that 
failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or 
shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice 
of issuance. If the Commission makes a final NSHC determination for any 
of these amendments, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take action on any amendment before 
60 days have elapsed will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10

[[Page 56440]]

days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    The following table provides the plant name, docket number, date of 
application, ADAMS accession number, and location in the application of 
the licensees' proposed NSHC determinations. For further details with 
respect to these license amendment applications, see the applications 
for amendment, which are available for public inspection in ADAMS. For 
additional direction on accessing information related to this document, 
see the ``Obtaining Information and Submitting Comments'' section of

III. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Combined Licenses

    During the period since publication of the last monthly notice, the 
Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has 
determined for each of these amendments that the application complies 
with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The 
Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    A notice of consideration of issuance of amendment to facility 
operating license or combined license, as applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing in connection with these 
actions, were published in the Federal Register as indicated in the 
safety evaluation for each amendment.

[[Page 56443]]

    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that 
these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.22(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to each action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession numbers for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-461; NRC-2024-0122]


Constellation Energy Generation, LLC; Clinton Power Station, Unit 
1; Partial Site Release

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Public meeting; request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering a 
request from Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation, the 
licensee) to approve the release of 172.7 acres of land to DeWitt 
County, Illinois, for the Clinton Lake Marina. Constellation had 
recently identified that a Quit Claim Deed was executed by AmerGen 
Energy Company, LLC, a previous licensee for Clinton Power Station, 
Unit 1, (CPS) on September 17, 2003, without obtaining approval in 
accordance with NRC regulations. Constellation states that this 
property has not been impacted by CPS operations. The NRC will review 
the request as directed by NRC regulations. The NRC is soliciting 
public comment on the requested action and invites stakeholders and 
interested persons to participate.

DATES: The public meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 24, 2024, 
from 5:30 p.m. until 7 p.m. central time (CT), at

II. Discussion

    Constellation Energy Generation LLC (Constellation, the licensee) 
is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF-62 for Clinton 
Power Station, Unit 1 (CPS). The license provides, among other things, 
that the CPS, Unit 1 is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders 
of the NRC now or hereafter in effect. The CPS license (NPF-62, Docket 
No. 50-461) is for a power reactor under part 50 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities.''
    The NRC received a request for approval of a partial site release 
from Constellation, by letter dated June 7, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23158A262), as supplemented by letter dated February 8, 2024 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML24039A182). Constellation requests NRC approval to 
remove and release from its 10 CFR part 50, license, 172.7 acres of 
land for the Clinton Lake Marina in accordance with 10 CFR 50.83(b). In 
its request, the licensee states that the property that is subject to 
this release request was not used for plant operations or storage of 
radioactive material. As described in 10 CFR 50.83(c), the NRC will 
determine whether the licensee has adequately evaluated the effect of 
releasing the properties per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.83(a)(1); 
determine whether the licensee's classification of any released areas 
as ``non-impacted'' is adequately justified; and if the NRC determines 
that the licensee's submittal is adequate, the NRC will inform the 
licensee in writing that the release is approved.

III. Request for Comment and Public Meeting

    The NRC will conduct a public meeting to answer questions and 
gather comments regarding Constellation's request for approval of the 
partial site release. The meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 24, 
2024, from 5:30 p.m. until 7 p.m., CT, at the Clinton City Hall, 118 W 
Washington St., Ste. 3, Clinton, IL 61727. Comments can be provided 
orally or in writing to the NRC staff present at the meeting. The NRC 
will consider and, if appropriate, respond to these written and verbal 
comments, but such comments will not otherwise constitute part of the 
decisional record.
    Please contact Joel S. Wiebe no later than July 17, 2024, by phone 
at 301-415-6606 or by email at [email protected], if accommodations or 
special equipment are needed for you to attend or to provide comments, 
so that the NRC staff can determine whether the request can be 
accommodated.
    For information regarding the meeting, monitor the NRC's Public 
Meeting Schedule website at https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg for 
information about the public meeting. The agenda will be posted no 
later than 10 days prior to the meeting.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-255; NRC-2024-0123]


Holtec Palisades, LLC; Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC; 
Palisades Nuclear Plant; Petition

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: 10 CFR 2.206 request; receipt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is giving notice 
that by petition dated December 5, 2023, Beyond Nuclear, Michigan State 
Energy Future, and Don't Waste Michigan (the petitioners) filed a 
petition to intervene and a request for hearing on a proceeding to 
exempt the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant (Palisades) from certain 
requirements in NRC regulations. In denying the request for hearing, 
the Commission referred Contention 2 of the request, regarding the 
misuse of decommissioning funds, to the enforcement petition process 
under NRC regulations. The petitioner's requests are included in the 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section of this document.

DATES: July 9, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James S. Kim, Office of Nuclear 
Reactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 
20555-0001; telephone: 301-415-4125; email: [email protected].

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 28, 2023, Holtec 
Decommissioning International, LLC (Holtec), on behalf of Holtec 
Palisades, LLC, submitted a request (ADAMS Accession No. ML23271A140) 
to exempt the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant (Palisades) from certain 
requirements in section 50.82 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Termination of license.'' On December 5, 2023, 
the petitioners filed a petition to intervene and a request for hearing 
on this exemption proceeding (ADAMS Accession No. ML23339A192). In 
denying the request for hearing (ADAMS Accession No. ML23352A325), the 
Commission referred Contention 2 of the request, regarding the misuse 
of decommissioning funds, to the enforcement petition process under 10 
CFR 2.206, ``Requests for action under this subpart.''
    The underlying concern in Contention 2 of the December 5, 2023, 
request is that ``Holtec misused the decommissioning trust fund (DTF) 
to keep Palisades in a status to restart the reactor, rather than to 
decommission the plant.'' The petitioners cited 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) 
regarding appropriate uses of the DTF. Specifically, the petition to 
intervene asserted that:
    1. Holtec expended $44 million from the Palisades DTF from June 28 
to December 31, 2022 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23090A140).
    2. Holtec continued improper utilization of Palisades DTF from 
December 31, 2022, to present.
    The NRC staff assembled a Petition Review Board (PRB) in accordance 
with NRC Management Directive (MD) 8.11, ``Review Process for 10 CFR 
2.206 Petitions,'' and its associated Directive Handbook 8.11, Section 
III (ADAMS Accession No. ML18296A043). On February 29, 2024 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML24061A014), the petition manager informed the 
petitioners that the PRB's initial assessment was to not accept the 
petition for review. The PRB's position was that the petition did not 
meet the MD 8.11 criteria for

[[Page 56438]]

accepting petitions under 10 CFR 2.206 because the issues raised 
regarding Holtec's use of the Palisades DTF in 2022 had already been 
addressed through the NRC's inspection and enforcement process.
    In August and November 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23276B452 and 
ADAMS Accession No. ML24045A147, respectively), the NRC completed 
inspections that addressed, in part, the use of the Palisades DTF. As a 
result of these inspections, the NRC identified several instances, 
totaling just over $57,000, in which the licensee used the Palisades 
DTF to pay for activities not considered legitimate decommissioning 
expenses per the definition in 10 CFR 50.2, ``Definitions.''
    The NRC confirmed that the unauthorized reimbursements from the 
Palisades DTF were the result of inadvertent oversights and/or 
inattention to detail in the coding associated with the billing for 
various projects and community donations. The licensee has implemented 
several process revisions to address order coding modification issues/
errors, as well as training to eliminate these issues from future DTF 
expenditures. In February 2024, the NRC issued Holtec a Severity Level 
IV Non-Cited Violation to address the illegitimate use of 
decommissioning funds at Palisades (ADAMS Accession No. ML24045A147).
    On February 29, 2024, along with the initial assessment, the 
petition manager offered the petitioners an opportunity to address the 
PRB in a public meeting. This meeting was held on April 10, 2024. The 
transcript of that meeting is publicly available in ADAMS under 
Accession No. ML24114A016 and is considered a supplement to the 
petition. During the April 10, 2024, meeting, the petitioners discussed 
DTF expenditures of $120 million noted in the 2023 Decommissioning 
Funding Status Report for Palisades, which was submitted to the NRC on 
March 29, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24089A117). The petitioners also 
raised concerns about whether the $120 million was properly used for 
decommissioning expenditures in accordance with the current NRC 
requirements and guidance.
    Following the April 10, 2024, public meeting, the PRB met to 
consider what had been presented during the meeting. The PRB found that 
the issues regarding use of the Palisades DTF in 2022 have been 
addressed through the inspection and enforcement process, as previously 
mentioned in this notice. Therefore, the PRB is not accepting those 
issues into the 10 CFR 2.206 process. The concerns the petitioners 
raised at the public meeting regarding the recently submitted 2023 
expenditure report for Palisades involve new information that has not 
yet been fully considered by the NRC. Therefore, in accordance with MD 
8.11, Section III.C, the PRB is accepting that portion of the 
petitioner's concern into the 10 CFR 2.206 process for further review. 
However, the PRB is holding the petition review in abeyance until the 
NRC's review of the 2023 expenditure report for Palisades is complete, 
as it is relevant to the decision on the 10 CFR 2.206 petition.

    Dated: July 2, 2024.

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Generic Clearance for the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on 
Agency Service Delivery.'' The NRC hereby informs potential respondents 
that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and that a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays 
a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on February 28, 2024, 89 FR 
14725.
    1. The title of the information collection: Generic Clearance for 
the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on Agency Service Delivery.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0217.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: On occasion, 
quarterly, and annually.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Individuals and 
households; businesses and organizations; State, Local, or Tribal 
governments.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 13,300.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 13,300.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 2,708.
    10. Abstract: The information collection activity will garner 
qualitative customer and stakeholder feedback in an efficient, timely 
manner, for the purpose of improving service delivery. By qualitative 
feedback we mean information that provides useful insights on 
perceptions and opinions, but are not statistical surveys that yield 
quantitative results that can be generalized to the population of 
study. This feedback will provide insights into customer or stakeholder 
perceptions, experiences and expectations, provide an early warning of 
issues with service, or focus attention on areas where communication, 
training or changes in operations might improve delivery of products or 
services. These collections will allow for ongoing, collaborative and 
actionable communications between the Agency and its customers and 
stakeholders. It will also allow feedback to contribute directly to the 
improvement of program management. Feedback collected under this 
generic clearance will provide useful information, but it will not 
yield data that can be generalized to the overall population. This type 
of generic clearance for qualitative information will not be used for 
quantitative information collections that are designed to yield 
reliably actionable results, such as monitoring trends over time or 
documenting program performance. Such data uses require more rigorous 
designs that address: The target population to which generalizations 
will be made, the sampling frame, the sample design (including 
stratification and clustering), the precision requirements or power 
calculations that justify the proposed sample size, the expected 
response rate, methods for assessing potential nonresponse bias, the 
protocols for data collection, and any testing procedures that were or 
will be undertaken prior to fielding the study. Depending on the degree 
of influence the results are likely to have, such collections may still 
be eligible for submission for other generic mechanisms that are 
designed to yield quantitative results.

II. Discussion

    On June 3, 2024, PFNW, Inc. submitted an application to the NRC for 
a license to export treated radioactive waste of Italian origin. The 
source of the waste is the European Commission's Joint Research Centre 
(JRC), located in Ispra, Italy. PFNW, Inc., intends to receive shipment 
of incoming waste consisting of liquid, solids, contaminated personal 
protective equipment, paper, plastic, glass, and combustible waste 
generated by the research projects at the JRC facility. PFNW will treat 
the waste by thermal processing, stabilization, and solidification. 
Residual ash and noncombustible metal would then be exported back to 
Italy for disposal. Resultant contaminants to be exported will include 
nickel-63 (Ni-63), carbon-14 (C-14), cesium-137 (Cs-137), cobalt-60 
(Co-60), techneticum-99 (Tc-99), strontium-90 (Sr-90), americium-241 
(Am-241), curium-244 (Cu-144), plutonium (Pu) and uranium-238 (U-238) 
in the form of residual ash and residual metal or non-combustible 
material, not to exceed 0.70 terabecquerels (TBq). PFNW, Inc. requests 
an expiration date of December 31, 2036.
    In accordance with paragraph 110.70(b) of Title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), the NRC is providing notice of the 
receipt of the application; providing the opportunity to submit written 
comments concerning the application; and providing the opportunity to 
request a hearing or petition for leave to intervene, for a period of 
30 days after publication of this notice in the Federal Register.
    A hearing request or petition for leave to intervene must include 
the information specified in 10 CFR 110.82(b). Any request for hearing 
or petition for leave to intervene shall be served by the requestor or 
petitioner in accordance with 10 CFR 110.89(a), either by delivery, by 
mail, or filed with the NRC electronically in accordance with the NRC's 
E-Filing rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 FR 46562; 
August 3, 2012). Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is located 
in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC 
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this 
proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic 
docket.
    The information concerning this application for an export license 
is as follows.

Attachment--Exemption

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Docket Nos. 72-1041, 50-498, and 50-499

South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company

South Texas Project Electric Generating Station Units 1 and 2

Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Company (STPNOC) is the 
holder of Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-76 and NPF-80, which 
authorize operation of the South Texas Project Electric Generating 
Station (STP), Units 1 and 2 in Bay City, Texas, pursuant to Part 50 of 
Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic 
Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities.'' The licenses 
provide, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, 
regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
now or hereafter in effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. STPNOC is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors under 
10 CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for storage 
of spent fuel at the STP ISFSI. Under the terms of the general license, 
STPNOC stores spent fuel at its STP ISFSI using the HI-STORM Flood/Wind 
(FW) Multi-Purpose Canister (MPC) Storage System in accordance with 
Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1032, Amendment No. 2.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated May 7, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System [ADAMS] Accession No. ML24128A157), and

[[Page 55660]]

supplemented on March 15, 2024 (ML24136A284), STPNOC requested an 
exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 
72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require STP to comply 
with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 2 (ML16280A008). If approved, STPNOC's exemption request 
would accordingly allow STP to shuffle (relocate) 10 loaded and to load 
two Multi-Purpose Canisters (MPC) with continuous basket shims (CBS) 
(i.e., MPC-37-CBS), an unapproved, variant basket design, in the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System, and thus, to load the systems in a storage 
condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 2, are not met.
    STPNOC currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System under CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 2, for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in the 
MPC-37 at the STP ISFSI. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer 
and manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, developed a 
variant of the design with CBS for the MPC-37, known as MPC-37-CBS. 
Holtec performed a non-mechanistic tip-over analysis with favorable 
results and implemented the CBS variant design under the provisions of 
10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, tests, and experiments,'' which allows 
licensees to make changes to cask designs without a CoC amendment under 
certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After evaluating the 
specific changes to the cask designs, the NRC determined that Holtec 
erred when it implemented the CBS variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as 
this is not the type of change allowed without a CoC amendment. For 
this reason, the NRC issued three Severity Level IV violations to 
Holtec (ML24016A190).
    STPNOC has near-term plans to shuffle (relocate) 10 already loaded 
MPC-37-CBS on the STP ISFSI pad in January 2025 and load two new MPC-
37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System in March 2025. While 
Holtec was required to submit a CoC amendment to the NRC to seek 
approval of the CBS variant design, such a process will not be 
completed in time to inform decisions for this near-term shuffling and 
loading campaign. Therefore, STPNOC submitted this exemption request in 
order to allow for the shuffling of 10 already loaded MPC-37-CBS in 
January 2025, and the future loading of two MPC-37-CBS in March 2025 at 
the STP ISFSI. This exemption is limited to the use of MPC-37-CBS in 
the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System only for shuffling the 10 already 
loaded canisters and specific near-term planned loading of two new 
canisters using the MPC-37-CBS variant basket design.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow STPNOC to shuffle (relocate) 10 already 
loaded and to load two MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System, in January and March 2025, respectively, at its STP ISFSI in a 
storage condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in 
the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 2, are not met. STPNOC is requesting an 
exemption from the provisions in 10 CFR part 72 that require the 
licensee to comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of 
the CoC for the approved cask model it uses. Section 72.7 allows the 
NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 72. This 
authority to grant exemptions is consistent with the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended, and is not otherwise inconsistent with NRC's 
regulations or other applicable laws. Additionally, no other law 
prohibits the activities that would be authorized by the exemption. 
Therefore, the NRC concludes that there is no statutory prohibition on 
the issuance of the requested exemption, and the NRC is authorized to 
grant the exemption by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    This exemption would allow STPNOC to shuffle (relocate) 10 already 
loaded MPC-37-CBS in January 2025 and to load two MPC-37-CBS in the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System in March 2025, at the STP ISFSI in a 
storage condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in 
the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 2, are not met. In support of its 
exemption request, STPNOC asserts that issuance of the exemption would 
not endanger life or property because a tip-over or handling event is 
administratively controlled, and that the containment boundary would be 
maintained in such an event. STPNOC relies, in part, on the approach in 
the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum (ML24018A085). The NRC issued 
this Safety Determination Memorandum to address whether, with respect 
to the enforcement action against Holtec regarding this violation, 
there was any need to take an immediate action for the cask systems 
that were already loaded with non-compliant basket designs. The Safety 
Determination Memorandum documents a risk-informed approach concluding 
that, during the design basis event of a non-mechanistic tip-over, the 
fuel in the basket in the MPC-37-CBS remains in a subcritical 
condition.
    STPNOC also provided site-specific technical information, including 
information explaining why the use of the approach in the NRC's Safety 
Determination Memorandum is appropriate for determining the safe use of 
the CBS variant baskets at the STP ISFSI. Specifically, STPNOC 
described that the analysis of the tip-over design basis event that is 
relied upon in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum, which 
demonstrates that the MPC confinement barrier is maintained, is 
documented in the updated final safety analysis report (UFSAR) for the 
HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 1032, Amendment 2, that is used 
at the STP site. STPNOC stated the transporter for handling of the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System at the STP ISFSI meets the design 
requirements described in the CoC No. 1032 technical specifications 
5.2.c.
    Additionally, STPNOC provided specific information from STP's 
72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 3, indicating the calculated dose 
rate is in compliance with 10 CFR 72.104(a), ``Criteria for radioactive 
materials in effluents and direct radiation from an ISFSI or MRS.'' The 
analysis of a design basis accident scenario also demonstrates 
compliance with 72.106, ``Controlled area of an ISFSI or MRS.'' 
Specifically, STPNOC stated that, as described in section 12.2 of HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System UFSAR, there are no accidents which could 
significantly affect shielding effectiveness of the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System. Coupled with the distance of the STP ISFSI to the site 
area boundary, STPNOC concluded that compliance with 72.104 and 72.106 
is not impacted by approving this exemption request.
    The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by STPNOC and 
concludes that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or 
property because the administrative controls STPNOC has in place at the

[[Page 55661]]

STP ISFSI sufficiently minimize the possibility of a tip-over or 
handling event, and that the containment boundary would be maintained 
in such an event. The staff confirmed that these administrative 
controls comply with the technical specifications and UFSAR for the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 1032, Amendment 2, that is used at 
the STP site. In addition, the staff confirmed that the information 
provided by STPNOC regarding STP's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 
3, demonstrates that the consequences of normal and accident conditions 
would be within the regulatory limits of the 10 CFR 72.104 and 10 CFR 
72.106. The staff also determined that the requested exemption is not 
related to any aspect of the physical security or defense of the STP 
ISFSI; therefore, granting the exemption would not result in any 
potential impacts to common defense and security.
    For these reasons, the NRC staff has determined that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow STPNOC to shuffle (relocate) 10 
already loaded MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System on the 
ISFSI pad at the STP ISFSI in January 2025, and load two MPC-37-CBS in 
the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System in March 2025 at the STP ISFSI, even 
though the CBS variant basket design is not part of the approved CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 2. According to STPNOC, the exemption is in the 
public interest because being able to load the two MPC-37-CBS will 
ensure adequate full core offload margin that is necessary for 
completing refueling outages, implementing enterprise projects, and 
sustaining safe and efficient operation of the nuclear facilities. 
STPNOC stated that the full core offload margin was adversely impacted 
when STP could not load the two MPC-37-CBS canisters in its 2022 
campaign. Further delay in the loading campaign would further impact 
the full core offload margin, and STPNOC would lose its ability to 
refuel the operating reactor. In addition, each fuel bundle contributes 
to the decay heat removal demand on the spent fuel pool cooling system, 
and removing the spent fuel bundles from the pool would allow for 
dispersion of the remaining heat load and reduce the consequence of a 
design basis accident associated with a loss of spent fuel pool cooling 
event. A crowded pool would also increase the likelihood of a fuel 
handling accident based on the additional fuel moves required to manage 
spent fuel pool loading with extra assemblies in the pool. STPNOC 
further stated that the shuffling (relocating) of the 10 already loaded 
MPC-37-CBS is necessary to optimize available space on the STP ISFSI 
pad for cask transporter maneuverability and minimize long-term damage 
to the STP ISFSI pad from cask transporter use, and thus ensures long-
term safe storage of fuel-loaded spent fuel storage canisters. The 
shuffling also provides additional shielding to plant structures (such 
as warehouses and fabrication shops which are to the south of the STP 
ISFSI pad) by moving the spent fuel storage canisters with higher 
calculated dose rates (i.e., those loaded in MPC-37-CBS) further north 
from the plant structures and also by placing the canisters with lower 
dose rate between the plant structures and MPC-37-CBS canisters.
    STPNOC has considered procuring empty MPC-37 canisters from other 
utilities; however, STP's fuel assemblies are longer than fuel 
assemblies of other utilities that load the MPC-37 model. Therefore, 
procuring MPC-37 canisters from other utilities is not an option.
    STPNOC has also considered procuring new MPC-37 canisters from the 
vendor and confirmed the approximate delivery would be in April 2025, 
which is after the planned March 2025 loading campaign. The loading 
campaigns are scheduled, budgeted, and planned several years in advance 
based on planned refueling outages, new fuel receipts, and other 
enterprise-level projects while considering the availability of 
specialty resources (equipment, vendors) to complete a campaign. Any 
delay to the March 2025 loading campaign would have cascading impacts 
to future new fuel receipts, refueling outages, and other enterprise 
projects. STPNOC asserted that delaying loading the two canisters 
beyond 2025 would result in loading these two canisters during the next 
scheduled loading campaign in 2028. Then, the number of canisters to be 
loaded would increase even more based on the new criticality analysis 
for the spent fuel pools to accommodate the planned storage of accident 
tolerant fuel.
    For the reasons described by STPNOC in the exemption request, as 
supplemented, the NRC agrees that it is in the public interest to grant 
the exemption. If the exemption is not granted, in order to comply with 
the CoC, STPNOC would have to keep the loaded MPC-37-CBS at the current 
location on the STP ISFSI pad, and would have to keep spent fuel in the 
spent fuel pool since it is not permitted to be loaded into MPC-37-CBS. 
This would impact STPNOC's ability to manage the full core offload 
margin in STP's spent fuel pool, resulting in undesirable cascading 
impacts to new fuel receipts, refueling outages, other enterprise 
projects, and potentially safe reactor operation. Denying the exemption 
request could also challenge the cask transporter maneuverability on 
the STP ISFSI pad, and thus increase the use of a cask transporter on 
the STP ISFSI pad, which could increase the long-term damage to the STP 
ISFSI pad and result in likely longer personnel radiation exposure from 
increased cask transporter use.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite, and there would be no significant increase in occupational or 
public radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The 
environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact was 
published on June 26, 2024 (89 FR 53452).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants STPNOC an 
exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212(a)(2), 
72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 with respect 
to the shuffling of 10 MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System 
in January 2025 and the future loading in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System of two MPC-37-CBS in March 2025.

    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2024-0101]


Applications for Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
Involving Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination 
and Containing Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information and 
Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: License amendment request; notice of opportunity to comment, 
request a hearing, and petition for leave to intervene; order imposing 
procedures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is 
considering approval of two amendment requests. The amendment requests 
are for Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2 and Edwin I. 
Hatch Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2. For each amendment request, the NRC 
proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards 
consideration (NSHC). Because each amendment request contains sensitive 
unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes 
procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation by 
persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.

DATES: Comments must be received by August 1, 2024. A request for a 
hearing or petitions for leave to intervene must be filed by September 
3, 2024. Any potential party as defined in section 2.4 of title 10 of 
the Code of Federal

[[Page 54862]]

Regulations (10 CFR) who believes access to SUNSI is necessary to 
respond to this notice must request document access by July 12, 2024.

II. Background

    Pursuant to section 189a.(1)-(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), the NRC is publishing this notice. The Act 
requires the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued or 
proposed to be issued and grants the Commission the authority to issue 
and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or 
combined license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission 
that such amendment involves NSHC, notwithstanding the pendency before 
the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.
    This notice includes notices of amendments containing SUNSI.

III. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration 
Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing

    The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following 
amendment requests involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 
10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance 
with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this 
proposed determination for each amendment request is shown as follows.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendments involve no significant hazards consideration. In addition, 
the Commission may issue any of these amendments prior to the 
expiration of the 30-day comment period if circumstances change during 
the 30-day comment period such that failure to act in a timely way 
would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility. If 
the Commission takes action on any of these amendments prior to the 
expiration of either the comment period or the notice period, it will 
publish a notice of issuance in the Federal Register. If the Commission 
makes a final no significant hazards consideration determination for 
any of these amendments, any hearing on those amendments will take 
place after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this 
action will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect

[[Page 54863]]

to that action. Petitions shall be filed in accordance with the 
Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 
2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If 
a petition is filed, the Commission or a presiding officer will rule on 
the petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration but 
the Commission determines to grant the amendment, the Commission will 
make a final determination on whether the amendments involve no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or

[[Page 54864]]

personal phone numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or 
other law requires submission of such information. With respect to 
copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose 
of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use 
application, participants should not include copyrighted materials in 
their submission.

                                          3.4.3.1 to increase the
                                          nominal mechanical relief
                                          setpoints for all safety/
                                          relief valves (S/RVs) of the
                                          reactor coolant system nuclear
                                          pressure relief system. The
                                          proposed changes would reduce
                                          the potential for S/RV pilot

                                          amendments also propose to
                                          change SR 3.1.7.7 to increase
                                          the minimum standby liquid

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information for Contention Preparation

Pacific Gas and Electric Company; Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant, 
Units 1 and 2; San Luis Obispo, CA

Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc.; Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, 
Units 1 and 2; Appling County, GA

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI).
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of hearing or 
opportunity for hearing, any potential party who believes access to 
SUNSI is necessary to respond to this notice may request access to 
SUNSI. A ``potential party'' is any person who intends to participate 
as a party by demonstrating standing and filing an admissible 
contention under 10 CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI submitted 
later than 10 days after publication of this notice will not be 
considered absent a showing of good cause for the late filing, 
addressing why the request could not have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemakings and 
Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy General Counsel 
for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the General 
Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001. 
The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both offices is: 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, 
Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the Secretary and 
the Office of the General Counsel are [email protected] and 
[email protected], respectively.\1\ The request must 
include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI under these 
procedures should be submitted as described in this paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice;
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1); and
    (3) The identity of the individual or entity requesting access to 
SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the need for the information in 
order to meaningfully participate in this adjudicatory proceeding. In 
particular, the request must explain why publicly available versions of 
the information requested would not be sufficient to provide the basis 
and specificity for a proffered contention.

[[Page 54865]]

    D. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraph C, the NRC staff will determine within 10 days of receipt of 
the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI.
    E. If the NRC staff determines that the requestor satisfies both 
D.(1) and D.(2), the NRC staff will notify the requestor in writing 
that access to SUNSI has been granted. The written notification will 
contain instructions on how the requestor may obtain copies of the 
requested documents, and any other conditions that may apply to access 
to those documents. These conditions may include, but are not limited 
to, the signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or 
Protective Order \2\ setting forth terms and conditions to prevent the 
unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of SUNSI by each individual who 
will be granted access to SUNSI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    F. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 days after 
receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more than 25 
days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) the 
information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing), the 
petitioner may file its SUNSI contentions by that later deadline.
    G. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI is denied by the NRC staff 
after a determination on standing and requisite need, the NRC staff 
shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly stating the 
reason or reasons for the denial.
    (2) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination by filing a challenge within 5 days of receipt of that 
determination with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    (3) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    H. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest independent of the proceeding. 
Such a challenge must be filed within 5 days of the notification by the 
NRC staff of its grant of access and must be filed with: (a) the 
presiding officer designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another administrative judge, or an 
Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); 
or (c) if another officer has been designated to rule on information 
access issues, with that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or denying access) is governed by 10 
CFR 2.311.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562; August 3, 2012, 78 FR 34247, June 7, 2013) apply to 
appeals of NRC staff determinations (because they must be served on 
a presiding officer or the Commission, as applicable), but not to 
the initial SUNSI request submitted to the NRC staff under these 
procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests 
for access to SUNSI, and motions for protective orders, in a timely 
fashion in order to minimize any unnecessary delays in identifying 
those petitioners who have standing and who have propounded contentions 
meeting the specificity and basis requirements in 10 CFR part 2. The 
attachment to this Order summarizes the general target schedule for 
processing and resolving requests under these procedures.
    It is so ordered.

    Dated: June 11, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

                            to Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards
                            Information (SUNSI) with information: (i)
                            supporting the standing of a potential party
                            identified by name and address; and (ii)
                            describing the need for the information in
                            order for the potential party to participate
                            meaningfully in an adjudicatory proceeding.
60.......................  Deadline for submitting petition for
                            intervention containing: (i) demonstration
                            of standing; and (ii) all contentions whose
                            formulation does not require access to SUNSI
                            (+25 Answers to petition for intervention;
                            +7 petitioner/requestor reply).
20.......................  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
                            staff informs the requestor of the staff's
                            determination whether the request for access
                            provides a reasonable basis to believe
                            standing can be established and shows need
                            for SUNSI. (NRC staff also informs any party
                            to the proceeding whose interest independent
                            of the proceeding would be harmed by the
                            release of the information.) If NRC staff
                            makes the finding of need for SUNSI and
                            likelihood of standing, NRC staff begins
                            document processing (preparation of
                            redactions or review of redacted documents).
25.......................  If NRC staff finds no ``need'' or no
                            likelihood of standing, the deadline for
                            petitioner/requestor to file a motion
                            seeking a ruling to reverse the NRC staff's
                            denial of access; NRC staff files copy of
                            access determination with the presiding
                            officer (or Chief Administrative Judge or
                            other designated officer, as appropriate).
                            If NRC staff finds ``need'' for SUNSI, the
                            deadline for any party to the proceeding
                            whose interest independent of the proceeding
                            would be harmed by the release of the
                            information to file a motion seeking a
                            ruling to reverse the NRC staff's grant of
                            access.
30.......................  Deadline for NRC staff reply to motions to
                            reverse NRC staff determination(s).

II. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility 
Operating License Nos. NPF-72 and

[[Page 54083]]

NPF-77, issued to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC, for the 
operation of Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2 (Docket Nos. 50-456 and 
50-457, respectively), located in Will County, IL. The proposed 
amendment would change TS SR 3.7.9.2 to allow a UHS temperature of less 
than or equal to 102.8 [deg]F until September 30, 2024.
    Historical meteorological and atmospheric conditions have resulted 
in the UHS temperature approaching the TS limit. These conditions 
include elevated air temperatures, high humidity, and low wind speed. 
Specifically, the summer of 2020 brought hot weather and drought 
conditions to the northern Illinois area resulting in sustained 
elevated UHS temperatures. In anticipation of these conditions 
occurring during the summer months of 2024, this license amendment 
request would change the UHS temperature TS limit until September 30, 
2024.
    Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the NRC will 
need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and NRC's regulations.
    The NRC has made a proposed determination that the license 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under 
the NRC's regulations in section 50.92 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Issuance of amendment,'' this means 
that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed 
amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction 
in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has 
provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards 
consideration, which is presented as follows:
    1. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The likelihood of a malfunction of any systems, structures, or 
components (SSCs) supported by the UHS is not significantly increased 
by increasing the allowable UHS temperature from less than or equal to 
102 [deg]F to less than or equal to 102.8 [deg]F. The UHS provides a 
heat sink for process and operating heat from safety related components 
during a transient or accident, as well as during normal operation. The 
proposed change does not make any physical changes to any plant SSCs, 
nor does it alter any of the assumptions or conditions upon which the 
UHS is designed. The UHS is not an initiator of any analyzed accident. 
All equipment supported by the UHS has been evaluated to demonstrate 
that their performance and operation remains as described in the 
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) with no increase in 
probability of failure or malfunction.
    The SSCs credited to mitigate the consequences of postulated design 
basis accidents remain capable of performing their design basis 
function. The change in maximum UHS temperature has been evaluated 
using the UFSAR described methods to demonstrate that the UHS remains 
capable of removing normal operating and post-accident heat. The change 
in UHS temperature and resulting containment response following a 
postulated design basis accident has been demonstrated to not be 
impacted. Additionally, all the UHS supported equipment, credited in 
the accident analysis to mitigate an accident, has been shown to 
continue to perform their design function as described in the UFSAR.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated.
    2. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The 
proposed change does not introduce any new modes of plant operation, 
change the design function of any SSC, or change the mode of operation 
of any SSC. There are no new equipment failure modes or malfunctions 
created as affected SSCs continue to operate in the same manner as 
previously evaluated and have been evaluated to perform as designed at 
the increased UHS temperature and as assumed in the accident analysis. 
Additionally, accident initiators remain as described in the UFSAR and 
no new accident initiators are postulated as a result of the increase 
in UHS temperature.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a 
new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
    3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety?
    Response: No.
    The proposed change continues to ensure that the maximum 
temperature of the cooling water supplied to the plant SSCs during a 
UHS design basis event remains within the evaluated equipment limits 
and capabilities assumed in the accident analysis. The proposed change 
does not result in any changes to plant equipment function, including 
setpoints and actuations. All equipment will function as designed in 
the plant safety analysis without any physical modifications. The 
proposed change does not alter a limiting condition for operation, 
limiting safety system setting, or safety limit specified in the 
Technical Specifications.
    The proposed change does not adversely impact the UHS inventory 
required to be available for the UFSAR described design basis accident 
involving the worst case 30-day period including losses for evaporation 
and seepage to support safe shutdown and cooldown of both Braidwood 
Station units. Additionally, the structural integrity of the UHS is not 
impacted and remains acceptable following the change, thereby ensuring 
that the assumptions for both UHS temperature and inventory remain 
valid.
    Therefore, since there is no adverse impact of this proposed change 
on the Braidwood Station safety analysis, there is no reduction in the 
margin of safety of the plant.
    The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on 
this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration.
    The NRC is seeking public comments on this proposed determination 
that the license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue the license amendment before expiration of the 60-
day notice period if the Commission concludes the amendment involves no 
significant hazards consideration. In addition, the Commission may 
issue the amendment prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment 
period if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such 
that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in 
derating or shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action 
prior to the expiration of either the comment period or the notice 
period, it

[[Page 54084]]

will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. If the 
Commission makes a final no significant hazards consideration 
determination, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very 
infrequently.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof may participate as a non-
party under 10 CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053. (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions and E-Filing

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is

[[Page 54085]]

publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded 
pursuant to an order of the presiding officer. If you do not have an 
NRC-issued digital ID certificate as previously described, click 
``cancel'' when the link requests certificates and you will be 
automatically directed to the NRC's electronic hearing docket where you 
will be able to access any publicly available documents in a particular 
hearing docket. Participants are requested not to include personal 
privacy information such as social security numbers, home addresses, or 
personal phone numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or 
other law requires submission of such information. With respect to 
copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose 
of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use 
application, participants should not include copyrighted materials in 
their submission.
    For further details with respect to this action, see the 
application for license amendment dated June 4, 2024 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24156A245).

II. Background

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
chapter 35), the NRC is requesting public comment on its intention to 
request the OMB's approval for the information collection summarized as 
follows.
    1. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR part 54, 
Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Power 
Plants.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0155.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: There is a 
one-time application for any licensee wishing to renew the operating 
license for its nuclear power plant. There is a one-time requirement 
for each licensee with a renewed operating license to submit a letter 
documenting the completion of inspection and testing activities. All 
holders of renewed licenses must perform yearly record keeping.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Commercial nuclear 
power plant licensees who wish to renew their operating licenses and 
holders of renewed licenses.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 71 (13 reporting 
responses + 58 recordkeepers).
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 68 (10 reporting 
respondents + 58 recordkeepers).
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 318,318 hours (255,818 
hours reporting plus 62,500 hours recordkeeping).
    10. Abstract: Part 54 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) establishes license renewal requirements for 
commercial nuclear power plants and describes the information that 
licensees must submit to the NRC when applying for a license renewal. 
The application must contain information on how the licensee will 
manage the detrimental effects of age-related degradation on certain 
plant systems, structures, and components to continue the plant's safe 
operation during the renewal term. The NRC needs this information to 
determine whether the licensee's actions will be effective in assuring 
the plants' continued safe operation during the period of extended 
operation. Holders of renewed licenses must retain in an auditable and 
retrievable form, for the term of the renewed operating license, all 
information and documentation required to document compliance with 10 
CFR part 54. The NRC needs access to this information for continuing 
effective regulatory oversight.

III. Specific Requests for Comments

    The NRC is seeking comments that address the following questions:
    1. Is the proposed collection of information necessary for the NRC 
to properly perform its functions? Does the information have practical 
utility? Please explain your answer.
    2. Is the estimate of the burden of the information collection 
accurate? Please explain your answer.
    3. Is there a way to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected?
    4. How can the burden of the information collection on respondents 
be minimized, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), as the lead 
agency, and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Loan Programs Office 
(LPO), as a cooperating agency, will conduct a scoping process to 
gather information to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to 
evaluate the environmental impacts from proposed Federal actions 
related to reauthorizing power operations at the Palisades Nuclear 
Plant (PNP). Specifically, the NRC is considering an exemption request, 
a license transfer request, and license amendment requests to support 
reauthorizing operation under the NRC license. DOE LPO's proposed 
action is to provide federal financial support (a loan guarantee) to 
support power operations at PNP. The NRC and DOE LPO are seeking public 
comment on the proposed actions and will hold a hybrid public scoping 
meeting.

DATES: The NRC, as the lead Federal agency, will hold a hybrid (virtual 
and in-person) public scoping meeting on July 11, 2024, at 6 p.m. 
eastern time (ET), at the Mendel Center, Grand Upton Hall, at Lake 
Michigan College, 1100 Yore Ave., Parking Lot 3, Benton Harbor, MI,

II. Background

    PNP consists of a single pressurized-water reactor designed by 
Combustion Engineering (with a turbine-generator designed by 
Westinghouse) and is located in Covert Township, Michigan, along the 
shoreline of Lake Michigan. Originally licensed for operation on March 
24, 1971, the NRC issued a renewed operating license for PNP on January 
17, 2007, with the renewed operating license term expiring on March 24, 
2031.
    After more than 40 years of commercial operation, PNP permanently 
ceased operations on May 20, 2022. On June 13, 2022, Entergy 
Operations, Inc., the licensee who operated the facility prior to 
transfer of the PNP license to Holtec Decommissioning International, 
LLC (HDI) and Holtec Palisades, LLC, submitted the certifications for 
permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from 
the reactor vessel in accordance with paragraph 50.82(a)(1) of title 10 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). When the NRC docketed the 
certifications, the PNP Renewed Facility Operating License (RFOL) No. 
DPR-20 no longer authorized operation of the reactor, or emplacement or 
retention of fuel into the reactor vessel, as provided by 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(2).

III. Discussion

    To return PNP to power operations, HDI has submitted (1) a request 
for an exemption from the requirement in 10 CFR 50.82(a)(2) that 
prohibits operation of the PNP reactor, or emplacement or retention of 
fuel into the reactor vessel; (2) a request for a license transfer from 
HDI (currently responsible for decommissioning activities at PNP) to 
Palisades Energy, LLC (which would be authorized to operate the 
reactor); and (3) four license amendment requests. These requests are 
listed in Section IV of this notice. If granted, the requested 
exemption, license transfer, and license amendments would allow 
Palisades Energy, LLC to place fuel into the PNP reactor vessel and 
resume power operations through March 24, 2031, the end of the renewed 
operating license term under the PNP RFOL No. DPR-20. The scope of the 
NRC's environmental review encompasses the determinations whether to 
grant or deny the exemption request, license transfer request, and four 
license amendment requests, including any revisions or supplements 
thereto or other regulatory or licensing requests submitted to the NRC 
that are necessary to reauthorize power operations of PNP.
    While HDI concluded that the proposed NRC actions meet the 
categorical exclusion (CATEX) criteria, the NRC staff, after reviewing 
the CATEX criteria in 10 CFR 51.22, the environmental impact statement 
(EIS) criteria in 10 CFR 51.20, the EA criteria in 10 CFR 51.21, and 
the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) Office Instruction LIC-
203, Revision 4, ``Procedural Guidance for Preparing Categorical 
Exclusions, Environmental Assessments, and Considering Environmental 
Issues,'' has determined to prepare an EA instead of invoking the 
categorical exclusions. This determination is based largely on 
concluding that the submittals (1) are either not covered by the 
criteria for a CATEX or, in the case of the license transfer request, 
do not fall within the factual basis underlying the corresponding 
CATEX; (2) are connected (i.e., interdependent) actions that should be 
considered together as part of the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) review; and (3) are not specifically covered by the criteria for 
preparing an EIS because the NRC does not yet know the significance of 
potential impacts from the proposed actions.
    To inform its environmental review, the NRC staff is considering a 
number of sources, including the previous NRC environmental review for 
PNP license renewal that is documented in the October 2006 ``Generic 
Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants, 
Supplement 27, Regarding Palisades Nuclear Plant--Final Report'' 
(hereafter ``License Renewal EIS Supplement''). The License Renewal EIS 
Supplement addresses the environmental impacts of continued operation 
during the license renewal period, which is the same operating period 
applicable to HDI's requests for reauthorization of power operations. 
The NRC staff is also considering the environmental information that 
HDI submitted in Enclosure 2, ``Environmental New and Significant 
Review Proposed Resumption of Power Operations Palisades Nuclear 
Plant,'' of the September 28, 2023, exemption request. As stated in the 
exemption request, Enclosure 2 documents HDI's ``environmental review 
of potentially new and significant information, and environmental 
issues not addressed in the'' License Renewal EIS Supplement.
    Once the NRC completes the draft EA, it will publish the draft EA 
and corresponding draft finding of no significant impact (FONSI), 
provided a determination of no significant impacts is reached, in a 
future Federal Register notice for governmental agency and public 
review and comment. Persons submitting comments during this scoping 
process will also receive a copy of the draft EA and draft FONSI once 
completed. Others who would like to

[[Page 53661]]

receive a copy when it is issued in the Federal Register for comment 
should notify the NRC per the ``For Further Information Contact'' 
section or monitor the Federal Register website.

NEPA Lead and Cooperating Agency Roles

    The NRC is the lead Federal agency for the NEPA of 1969, as amended 
(42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.), process for the proposed action. The NRC may 
invite any Federal, State, Tribal, or local agency that has 
jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any 
environmental impact involved in a proposal to become cooperating 
agencies in the preparation of the EA for the proposed action. As such, 
the DOE LPO is a cooperating agency in the preparation of the EA. The 
DOE LPO proposed action is to provide federal financial support (a loan 
guarantee) to HDI for the reauthorization of power operations at PNP, 
specifically the fuel loading and power restart activities.
    The Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment, Section 1706 Program, 
authorizes the Secretary of Energy to issue loan guarantees for 
projects that: (1) retool, repower, repurpose, or replace Energy 
Infrastructure (facilities used for electric generation or 
transmission, or facilities used for fossil fuel-related production, 
processing, and delivery) that has ceased operations; or (2) enable 
operating Energy Infrastructure to avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester 
air pollutants or emissions of greenhouse gases. The DOE LPO will 
utilize the EA to inform its decision regarding its proposed action for 
the potential reauthorization of PNP, specifically the fuel loading and 
power restart activities. Based on the review, the DOE LPO would issue 
a Record of Decision documenting its decision regarding the proposed 
loan guarantee no sooner than 30 days after the publication of the 
final EA.

Anticipated Permits, Authorizations, and Consultations

    Federal permits, authorizations, or consultations may be needed for 
the proposed actions, including consultation or review under the 
Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; National Historic 
Preservation Act (NHPA), 54 U.S.C. 300101 et seq.; and Executive Order 
13175 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments); 
\1\ consistency review under the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 
1451 et seq.; and possibly reviews under other laws and regulations 
determined to be applicable to the proposed action. To the fullest 
extent possible, the NRC will prepare a draft EA concurrently and 
integrate analyses required by other Federal environmental review 
requirements. The draft EA will list all Federal permits, licenses, and 
other authorizations that must be obtained in implementing the proposed 
action.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The NRC's conformance with Executive Order 13175 is 
addressed in a March 10, 2010, letter from the NRC to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Specific to NHPA, the regulations in 36 CFR 800.8, ``Coordination 
with the National Environmental Policy Act,'' allow agencies to use the 
NEPA process to fulfill the requirements of Section 106 of the NHPA. 
Therefore, pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8(c), the NRC intends to use its NEPA 
process and documentation required for the preparation of the draft EA 
on the proposed action to comply with Section 106 of the NHPA in lieu 
of the procedures set forth at 36 CFR 800.3 through 800.6.

V. Request for Comment

    This notice informs the public of the NRC's intention to conduct 
environmental scoping and prepare a draft EA and draft FONSI, provided 
a determination of no significant impacts is reached, related to the 
exemption request, license transfer request, and license amendment 
requests for PNP's potential reauthorization of power operation and 
provides the public an opportunity to participate in the environmental 
scoping process. While the NRC is not required by the regulations in 10 
CFR part 51 to publish a notice of intent or conduct scoping when it 
has decided to prepare an EA for a requested licensing action, in this 
instance the NRC considered the unique nature of the requests and the 
demonstrated high public interest in the requested actions and 
determined that publication of a notice and conducting scoping was 
merited and in synchronization with NRC's strategic plan and principles 
of good regulation. The NRC considers stakeholder engagement and 
transparency in its activities to be cornerstones for effective 
regulation. To that end, the NRC's strategic plan highlights conducting 
business in a transparent, open, and

[[Page 53662]]

independent manner that builds stakeholder confidence and fosters 
engagement such as those provided through public meetings.
    The NRC intends to gather the information necessary to prepare an 
EA related to the exemption, license transfer, and license amendment 
request submittals for PNP's potential reauthorization of power 
operations. The NRC is publishing this notice and conducting scoping as 
a matter of discretion; this notice and the associated scoping process 
are not subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 51.
    The EA will evaluate the environmental impacts of the exemption, 
license transfer, and license amendment requests for PNP's potential 
reauthorization to power operation, and reasonable alternatives 
thereto. Possible alternatives to the proposed action include the no-
action alternative.
    As part of its environmental review, the NRC will first conduct a 
scoping process for the EA and, as soon as practicable thereafter, will 
prepare a draft EA and draft FONSI, provided a determination of no 
significant impacts is reached, for public comment. Participation in 
this scoping process by members of the public and local, State, Tribal, 
and Federal government agencies is encouraged. The scoping process for 
the EA and FONSI will be used to accomplish the following:
    a. Define the proposed action that is to be the subject of the EA;
    b. Determine the scope of the EA and identify the significant 
issues to be analyzed in depth;
    c. Identify and eliminate from detailed study those issues that are 
peripheral or are not significant or that have been covered by prior 
environmental review;
    d. Identify any other EAs and EISs that are being or will be 
prepared that are related to, but are not part of, the scope of the EA 
under consideration;
    e. Identify other environmental review and consultation 
requirements related to the proposed action;
    f. Identify parties consulting with the NRC under the NHPA, as set 
forth in 36 CFR 800.8(c)(1)(i);
    g. Identify any cooperating agencies and, as appropriate, allocate 
assignments for preparation and schedules for completing the EA and 
FONSI to the NRC and any cooperating agencies; and
    h. Describe how the EA will be prepared, including any contractor 
assistance to be used.
    The NRC invites the following entities to participate in scoping:
    a. The applicants, HDI, Holtec Palisades, LLC, and Palisades 
Energy, LLC;
    b. Any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or that is 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    c. Affected State and local government agencies, including those 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    d. Any affected Native American Indian Tribe;
    e. Any person who requests or has requested an opportunity to 
participate in the scoping process; and
    f. Any person who has petitioned or intends to petition for leave 
to intervene under 10 CFR 2.309.

IV. Public Scoping Meeting

    The NRC is announcing that it will hold a hybrid public scoping 
meeting for the PNP exemption request, license transfer, and license 
amendment request submittals. The hybrid public scoping meeting will be 
held on July 11, 2024, at the Mendel Center, Grand Upton Hall, at Lake 
Michigan College, 1100 Yore Ave, Parking Lot 3, Benton Harbor, MI 
49022. A court reporter will transcribe all comments received during 
the public scoping meetings. To be considered, comments must be 
provided either at a transcribed public meeting or in writing, as 
discussed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. Persons interested 
in attending the hybrid meeting should monitor the NRC's Public Meeting 
Schedule website at https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg for additional 
information and agenda for the meeting. Please contact Laura 
Willingham, at [email protected] no later than July 3, 2024, if 
accommodations or special equipment is needed to attend or to provide 
comments, so that the NRC can determine whether the request can be 
accommodated.
    The public scoping meeting will include: (1) an overview by the NRC 
and the DOE of the environmental review processes, the proposed scope 
of HDI's licensing requests, and the proposed environmental review 
schedule; and (2) the opportunity for interested government agencies, 
organizations, and individuals to submit comments or suggestions on 
environmental issues or the proposed scope of the EA.
    Participation in the scoping process for the EA related to HDI's 
exemption, license transfer, and licensing amendment requests for the 
potential reauthorization to power operations does not entitle 
participants to become parties to the proceeding to which the EA 
relates. Matters related to participation in any hearing are outside 
the scope of matters to be discussed at this public meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an exemption from the 
requirement in paragraph 37.11(c)(2) of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) to secure category 1 or category 2 radioactive 
waste with a locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access 
control point for Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33, DPR-
52, and DPR-68, issued to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), for 
operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2, and 3 (Browns 
Ferry), respectively, located in Limestone County, Alabama. Because 
this proposed exemption does not fall within the NRC's list of 
categorical exclusions in 10 CFR 51.22, the NRC prepared an EA, as 
required by 10 CFR 51.21. Based on the results of the EA that follows, 
the NRC has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement 
for the exemption and is issuing a FONSI.
    TVA is requesting an exemption from the requirement to ``[u]se a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point'' 
for category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive material as set forth in 
10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) for the low-level radioactive waste storage facility 
(LLRWSF) at the Browns Ferry site. The exemption is being requested to 
address a regulatory noncompliance which has resulted in the issuance 
of minor violations at the Browns Ferry site.
    The LLRWSF is used to store the original steam dryers for Browns 
Ferry, which were removed during the extended power uprate outages. The 
stored steam dryers exceed the threshold for a category 2 quantity of 
radioactivity, as defined in 10 CFR 37.5, but do not contain discrete 
radioactive sources, ion-exchange resins, or activated materials that 
weigh less than 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds), as described in 10 CFR 
37.11(c).
    TVA describes the LLRWSF as a robust structure consisting of a 
group of rectangular box-type concrete storage modules that are located 
outside the Browns Ferry protected area but inside the owner-controlled 
area and exclusion zone. Each LLRWSF storage module is closed by five 
precast concrete caps, weighing approximately 45,813 kilograms (101,000 
pounds) each. Removal of the caps is the only access point to the 
stored steam dryers and requires heavy lifting and rigging equipment 
that cannot be staged or utilized quickly. Removal of the caps is an 
evolution that is easily observable over an extended period of time.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would exempt TVA from the requirement to use a 
locked door or gate with a monitored alarm at the access control point 
to the LLRWSF storage vaults utilized for the original steam dryers at 
Browns Ferry.
    The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's exemption 
request dated September 28, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23271A063), as 
supplemented by letter dated March 14, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24074A457).

Need for the Proposed Action

    The regulation at 10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) requires, in part, licensees 
who possess radioactive waste that contains category 1 or category 2 
quantities of radioactive waste to secure the radioactive waste with a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point. 
The Browns Ferry original steam dryers exceed the threshold for a 
category 2 quantity of radioactivity, but do not contain discrete 
radioactive sources, ion-exchange resins, or activated materials that 
weigh less than 2,000 kilograms and, therefore, are not exempt from the 
requirements in 10 CFR 37.11(c). As such, the licensee is required to 
have a monitored alarm at the access control point to the LLRWSF where 
the steam dryers are stored. As described in the request for exemption 
and confirmed in the supplement, the only access point to the stored 
steam dryers is via the removal of the 45,813-kilogram concrete caps, 
and removal of these caps would require setting up heavy rigging and 
lifting equipment.
    On March 13, 2014, the NRC issued Enforcement Guidance Memorandum 
(EGM) 2014-001, ``Interim Guidance for Dispositioning 10 CFR part 37 
Violations with Respect to Large Components or Robust Structures 
Containing Category 1 or Category 2 Quantities of Material at Power 
Reactor Facilities Licensed Under 10 CFR parts 50 and 52'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML14056A151), to provide guidance to NRC staff for 
dispositioning violations associated with 10 CFR part 37 with respect 
to large components containing category 1 and category 2 quantities of 
radioactive material stored in robust structures at power reactor 
facilities licensed under 10 CFR parts 50 and 52. The EGM defines a 
large component as an item weighing 2,000 kilograms or more, but not 
containing either discrete

[[Page 53665]]

sources or ion exchange resins, and limits the components to steam 
generators, steam dryers, turbine rotors, reactor vessels, reactor 
vessel heads, reactor coolant pumps, and shielding blocks. It also 
defines a robust structure as a closed concrete bunker or modular vault 
for which access to the radioactive materials contained within the 
structure is gained only through the use of heavy equipment to remove 
structural components or large access blocks that weigh 2,000 kilograms 
or more. The EGM allows the NRC Regional Offices to evaluate potential 
violations and consider if the use of enforcement discretion is 
warranted under certain circumstances. The EGM will remain effective 
until the underlying technical issue is dispositioned through 
rulemaking or other regulatory action. Therefore, to address a 
regulatory noncompliance and avoid future violations, TVA has requested 
an exemption.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff has assessed the potential environmental impacts from 
granting the requested exemption. The proposed action involves no new 
construction or modification of the facilities at Browns Ferry, and no 
changes to the contents of the LLRWSF vaults where the original steam 
dryers are stored. Therefore, the proposed action would have no direct 
impact on land and water use or water quality, including terrestrial 
and aquatic biota, and there would be no change in the quality or 
quantity of radiological and non-radiological effluents. Additionally, 
there would be no change in dose to members of the public and 
occupational workers. The proposed action would have no effect on air 
pollutant emissions or ambient air quality. In addition, the proposed 
action would have no noticeable effect on socioeconomic and 
environmental justice conditions in the region, and no adverse effect 
on historic and cultural resources. Therefore, the proposed action 
would have no significant effect on the quality of the human 
environment.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered 
denial of the exemption request (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Denial of the exemption request would result in the need to install a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm, and there would be no change 
in the current environmental impacts. Accordingly, the environmental 
impacts from the proposed action and the no-action alternative are 
similar.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    No agencies or persons were consulted. Because the proposed action 
is not a type of activity that has the potential to cause effects on 
historic properties, the NRC has no further obligations under section 
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Similarly, the proposed 
action would not affect threatened or endangered species; therefore, 
consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is not 
required.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    TVA requested an exemption from the requirement in 10 CFR 
37.11(c)(2) to have a locked gate or door with a monitored alarm at the 
access control point for the Browns Ferry LLRWSF vaults where the 
original steam dryers are stored. Based on the review of available 
information, including the information provided in the licensee's 
request for exemption and its response to a request for additional 
information, the NRC determined that the proposed action would not have 
any significant environmental impacts. Also, the impacts of the ``no-
action'' alternative would be similar to the impacts of the proposed 
action.
    Consistent with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC conducted an environmental 
review of the proposed action and, in accordance with 10 CFR 
51.32(a)(4), this FONSI incorporates the EA in Section II of this 
document by reference. Therefore, the NRC concludes that the proposed 
action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human 
environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined an environmental 
impact statement for the proposed action is not needed.
    This FONSI and related environmental documents are available for 
public inspection online in the ADAMS Public Documents collection at 
https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html. Persons who do not have 
access to ADAMS or who encounter problems in accessing the documents 
located in ADAMS should contact the NRC's PDR reference staff by 
telephone at 1-800-397-4209 or 301-415-4737, or by email to

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an exemption from the 
requirement in paragraph 37.11(c)(2) of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) to secure category 1 or category 2 radioactive 
waste with a locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access 
control point for Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-90 and NPF-96 
issued to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), for operation of the Watts 
Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2 (Watts Bar), respectively, located in 
Rhea County, Tennessee. Because this proposed exemption does not fall 
within the NRC's list of categorical exclusions in 10 CFR 51.22, the 
NRC prepared an EA, as required by 10 CFR 51.21. Based on the results 
of the EA that follows, the NRC has determined not to prepare an 
environmental impact statement for the exemption and is issuing a 
FONSI.
    TVA is requesting an exemption from the requirement to ``[u]se a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point'' 
for category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive material as set forth in 
10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) for the old steam generator storage facilities 
(OSGSFs) at the Watts Bar site. The exemption is being requested to 
address a regulatory noncompliance which has resulted in the issuance 
of minor violations at the Watts Bar site.
    The OSGSFs are used to store the contaminated old steam generators 
(OSGs) that have been removed from their respective Watts Bar 
containments. The OSGs exceed the threshold for a category 2 quantity 
of radioactivity, as defined in 10 CFR 37.5, but do not contain 
discrete radioactive sources, ion-exchange resins, or activated 
materials that weigh less than 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds), as 
described in 10 CFR 37.11(c).
    TVA describes the OSGSFs as robust structures that are closed with 
ten stacked precast concrete panels weighing approximately 17,237 
kilograms (38,000 pounds) each. The OSGSFs are located outside the 
Watts Bar protected area but within the exclusion area and site 
boundary. Removal of the concrete panels is the only access point of 
sufficient size to remove an OSG and requires heavy lifting and rigging 
equipment that cannot be staged nor utilized quickly. Removal of the 
concrete panels is an evolution that is easily observable over an 
extended period of time.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would exempt TVA from the requirement to use a 
locked door or gate with a monitored alarm at the access control point 
to the OSGSFs utilized for the OSGs at Watts Bar.
    The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's exemption 
request dated September 28, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23271A063), as 
supplemented by letter dated March 14, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24074A457).

Need for the Proposed Action

    The regulation at 10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) requires, in part, licensees 
who possess radioactive waste that contains category 1 or category 2 
quantities of radioactive waste to secure the radioactive waste with a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point. 
The Watts Bar OSGs exceed the threshold for a category 2 quantity of 
radioactivity, but do not contain discrete radioactive sources, ion-
exchange resins, or activated materials that weigh less than 2,000 
kilograms and, therefore, are not exempt from the requirements in 10 
CFR 37.11(c). As such, the licensee is required to have a monitored 
alarm at the access control point to the OSGSFs where the OSGs are 
stored. As described in the request for exemption, the only access 
point of sufficient size to the OSGs is via the removal of the 17,237-
kilogram concrete panels, and removal of these panels would require 
setting up heavy rigging and lifting equipment.
    On March 13, 2014, the NRC issued Enforcement Guidance Memorandum 
(EGM) 2014-001, ``Interim Guidance for Dispositioning 10 CFR part 37 
Violations with Respect to Large Components or Robust Structures 
Containing Category 1 or Category 2 Quantities of Material at Power 
Reactor Facilities Licensed Under 10 CFR parts 50 and 52'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML14056A151), to provide guidance to NRC staff for 
dispositioning violations associated with 10 CFR part 37 with respect 
to large components containing category 1 and category 2 quantities of 
radioactive material stored in robust structures at power reactor 
facilities licensed under 10 CFR parts 50 and 52. The EGM defines a 
large component as an item weighing 2,000 kilograms or more, but not 
containing either discrete sources or ion exchange resins, and limits 
the components to steam generators, steam dryers, turbine rotors, 
reactor vessels, reactor vessel heads, reactor coolant pumps, and 
shielding blocks. It also defines a robust structure as a closed 
concrete bunker or modular vault for which access to the radioactive 
materials contained within the structure is gained only through the use 
of heavy equipment to remove structural components or large access 
blocks that weigh 2,000 kilograms or more. The EGM allows the NRC 
Regional Offices to evaluate potential violations and consider if the 
use of enforcement discretion is warranted under certain circumstances. 
The EGM will remain effective until the underlying technical issue is 
dispositioned through rulemaking or other regulatory action. Therefore, 
to address a regulatory noncompliance and avoid future violations, TVA 
has requested an exemption.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff has assessed the potential environmental impacts from 
granting the requested exemption. The proposed action involves no new 
construction or modification of the facilities at Watts Bar, and no 
changes to the contents of OSGSFs. Therefore, the proposed action would 
have no direct impact on land and water use or water quality, including 
terrestrial and aquatic biota, and there would be no change in the 
quality or quantity of radiological and non-radiological effluents. 
Additionally, there would be no change in dose to members of the public 
and occupational workers. The proposed action would have no effect on 
air pollutant emissions or ambient

[[Page 53667]]

air quality. In addition, the proposed action would have no noticeable 
effect on socioeconomic and environmental justice conditions in the 
region, and no adverse effect on historic and cultural resources. 
Therefore, the proposed action would have no significant effect on the 
quality of the human environment.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered 
denial of the exemption request (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Denial of the exemption request would result in the need to install a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm, and there would be no change 
in the current environmental impacts. Accordingly, the environmental 
impacts from the proposed action and the no-action alternative would be 
similar.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    No agencies or persons were consulted. Because the proposed action 
is not a type of activity that has the potential to cause effects on 
historic properties, the NRC has no further obligations under section 
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Similarly, the proposed 
action would not affect threatened or endangered species; therefore, 
consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is not 
required.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    TVA requested an exemption from the requirement in 10 CFR 
37.11(c)(2) to have a locked gate or door with a monitored alarm at the 
access control point for the Watts Bar OSGSFs where the old steam 
generators are stored. Based on the review of available information, 
including information provided in the licensee's request for exemption 
and its response to a request for additional information, the NRC 
determined that the proposed action would not have any significant 
environmental impacts. Also, the impacts of the ``no-action'' 
alternative would be the same as the impacts of the proposed action.
    Consistent with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC conducted an environmental 
review of the proposed action and, in accordance with 10 CFR 
51.32(a)(4), this FONSI incorporates the EA in Section II of this 
document by reference. Therefore, the NRC concludes that the proposed 
action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human 
environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined an environmental 
impact statement for the proposed action is not needed.
    This FONSI and related environmental documents are available for 
public inspection online in the ADAMS Public Documents collection at 
https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html. Persons who do not have 
access to ADAMS or who encounter problems in accessing the documents

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an exemption from the 
requirement in paragraph 37.11(c)(2) of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) to secure category 1 or category 2 radioactive 
waste with a locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access 
control point for Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-77 and 
DPR-79, issued to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), for operation of 
the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2 (Sequoyah), respectively, 
located in Hamilton County, Tennessee. Because this proposed exemption 
does not fall

[[Page 53668]]

within the NRC's list of categorical exclusions in 10 CFR 51.22, the 
NRC prepared an EA, as required by 10 CFR 51.21. Based on the results 
of the EA that follows, the NRC has determined not to prepare an 
environmental impact statement for the exemption and is issuing a 
FONSI.
    TVA is requesting an exemption from the requirement to ``[u]se a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point'' 
for category 1 and 2 quantities of radioactive material as set forth in 
10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) for the old steam generator storage facilities 
(OSGSFs) at the Sequoyah site. The exemption is being requested to 
address a regulatory noncompliance which has resulted in the issuance 
of minor violations at the Sequoyah site.
    The OSGSFs are used to store the contaminated old steam generators 
(OSGs) that have been removed from their respective Sequoyah 
containments. The OSGs exceed the threshold for a category 2 quantity 
of radioactivity, as defined in 10 CFR 37.5, but do not contain 
discrete radioactive sources, ion-exchange resins, or activated 
materials that weigh less than 2,000 kilograms (4,409 pounds), as 
described in 10 CFR 37.11(c).
    TVA describes the OSGSFs as robust structures that are closed with 
ten stacked precast concrete panels weighing approximately 17,237 
kilograms (38,000 pounds) each. The OSGSFs are located outside the 
Sequoyah protected area but within the exclusion area and site 
boundary. Removal of the concrete panels is the only access point of 
sufficient size to remove an OSG and requires heavy lifting and rigging 
equipment that cannot be staged or utilized quickly. Removal of the 
concrete panels is an evolution that is easily observable over an 
extended period of time.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would exempt TVA from the requirement to use a 
locked door or gate with a monitored alarm at the access control point 
to the OSGSFs utilized for the OSGs at Sequoyah.
    The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's exemption 
request dated September 28, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23271A063), as 
supplemented by letter dated March 14, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24074A457).

Need for the Proposed Action

    The regulation at 10 CFR 37.11(c)(2) requires, in part, licensees 
who possess radioactive waste that contains category 1 or category 2 
quantities of radioactive waste to secure the radioactive waste with a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm at the access control point. 
The Sequoyah OSGs exceed the threshold for a category 2 quantity of 
radioactivity, but do not contain discrete radioactive sources, ion-
exchange resins, or activated materials that weigh less than 2,000 
kilograms and, therefore, are not exempt from the requirements in 10 
CFR 37.11(c). As such, the licensee is required to have a monitored 
alarm at the access control point to the OSGSFs where the OSGs are 
stored. As described in the request for exemption, the only access 
point of sufficient size to the OSGs is via the removal of the 17,237-
kilogram concrete panels, and removal of these panels would require 
setting up heavy rigging and lifting equipment.
    On March 13, 2014, the NRC issued Enforcement Guidance Memorandum 
(EGM) 2014-001, ``Interim Guidance for Dispositioning 10 CFR part 37 
Violations with Respect to Large Components or Robust Structures 
Containing Category 1 or Category 2 Quantities of Material at Power 
Reactor Facilities Licensed Under 10 CFR parts 50 and 52'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML14056A151), to provide guidance to NRC staff for 
dispositioning violations associated with 10 CFR part 37 with respect 
to large components containing category 1 and category 2 quantities of 
radioactive material stored in robust structures at power reactor 
facilities licensed under 10 CFR parts 50 and 52. The EGM defines a 
large component as an item weighing 2,000 kilograms or more, but not 
containing either discrete sources or ion exchange resins, and limits 
the components to steam generators, steam dryers, turbine rotors, 
reactor vessels, reactor vessel heads, reactor coolant pumps, and 
shielding blocks. It also defines a robust structure as a closed 
concrete bunker or modular vault for which access to the radioactive 
materials contained within the structure is gained only through the use 
of heavy equipment to remove structural components or large access 
blocks that weigh 2,000 kilograms or more. The EGM allows the NRC 
Regional Offices to evaluate potential violations and consider if the 
use of enforcement discretion is warranted under certain circumstances. 
The EGM will remain effective until the underlying technical issue is 
dispositioned through rulemaking or other regulatory action. Therefore, 
to address a regulatory noncompliance and avoid future violations, TVA 
has requested an exemption.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff has assessed the potential environmental impacts from 
granting the requested exemption. The proposed action involves no new 
construction or modification of the facilities at Sequoyah, and no 
changes to the contents of OSGSFs. Therefore, the proposed action would 
have no direct impact on land and water use or water quality, including 
terrestrial and aquatic biota, and there would be no change in the 
quality or quantity of radiological and non-radiological effluents. 
Additionally, there would be no change in dose to members of the public 
and occupational workers. The proposed action would have no effect on 
air pollutant emissions or ambient air quality. In addition, the 
proposed action would have no noticeable effect on socioeconomic and 
environmental justice conditions in the region, and no adverse effect 
on historic and cultural resources. Therefore, the proposed action 
would have no significant effect on the quality of the human 
environment.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered 
denial of the exemption request (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Denial of the exemption request would result in the need to install a 
locked door or gate with monitored alarm, and there would be no change 
in the current environmental impacts. Accordingly, the environmental 
impacts from the proposed action and the no-action alternative would be 
similar.
    Alternative Use of Resources
    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.
    Agencies and Persons Consulted
    No agencies or persons were consulted. Because the proposed action 
is not a type of activity that has the potential to cause effects on 
historic properties, the NRC has no further obligations under section 
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Similarly, the proposed 
action would not affect threatened or endangered species; therefore, 
consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is not 
required.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    TVA requested an exemption from the requirement in 10 CFR 
37.11(c)(2) to have a locked gate or door with a

[[Page 53669]]

monitored alarm at the access control point for the Sequoyah OSGSFs 
where the old steam generators are stored. Based on the review of 
available information, including the information provided in the 
licensee's request for exemption and its response to a request for 
additional information, the NRC determined that the proposed action 
would not have any significant environmental impacts. Also, the impacts 
of the ``no-action'' alternative would be similar to the impacts of the 
proposed action.
    Consistent with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC conducted an environmental 
review of the proposed action and, in accordance with 10 CFR 
51.32(a)(4), this FONSI incorporates the EA in Section II of this 
document by reference. Therefore, the NRC concludes that the proposed 
action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human 
environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined an environmental 
impact statement for the proposed action is not needed.
    This FONSI and related environmental documents are available for 
public inspection online in the ADAMS Public Documents collection at 
https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html. Persons who do not have 
access to ADAMS or who encounter problems in accessing the documents

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is reviewing an exemption request from STPNOC, dated May 7, 
2024, and supplemented on May 15, 2024. STPNOC is requesting an 
exemption, pursuant to section 72.7 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), in paragraphs 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 
72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require STPNOC to 
comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 2. If approved, the exemption would allow STPNOC to 
shuffle (relocate) 10 loaded MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System on the ISFSI pad at the STP ISFSI in January 2025, and load two 
MPC-37-CBS in March 2025 in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the 
STP ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 2, are not met.

II. Environmental Assessment

Background

    STP is located in Bay City, Texas. STP occupies a 12,200-acre site 
west of the Colorado River and approximately 70 miles southwest of 
Houston. Unit 1 began operating in 1988 and Unit 2 began operating in 
1989. STPNOC has been storing spent nuclear fuel in an ISFSI at STP 
under a general license as authorized by 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, 
``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' 
STPNOC currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System under CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 2, for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a 
specific MPC (i.e., MPC-37) at the STP ISFSI.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The CoC is the NRC approved design for each dry cask storage 
system. The proposed action would exempt the applicant from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 only as these requirements pertain to the use 
of the MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System for the near-
term planned shuffling and loading of the systems. The exemption would 
allow STPNOC to shuffle (relocate) 10 loaded MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM 
FW MPC Storage System on the ISFSI pad at the STP ISFSI in January 
2025, and load two new MPC-37-CBS in March 2025 in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System at the STP ISFSI in a storage condition, despite the 
MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System not being in 
compliance with the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 2.
    The HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC provides the requirements, 
conditions, and operating limits necessary for the use of the system to 
store spent fuel. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and 
manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, developed a variant 
of the design with CBS for the MPC-37, known as MPC-37-CBS. Holtec 
originally implemented the CBS variant design under the provisions of 
10 CFR 72.48, which allows licensees to make changes to cask designs 
without a CoC amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 
72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, 
the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS 
variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this was not the type of change 
allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three 
Severity Level IV violations to Holtec. STPNOC plans to shuffle 
(relocate) the 10 loaded MPC-37-CBS canisters on the ISFSI pad in 
January 2025 and to load two new MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System in March 2025. This exemption considers the relocation 
of the 10 already loaded canisters and the near-term planned loading of 
the two canisters with the CBS variant basket design.

Need for the Proposed Action

    STPNOC requested this exemption in order to allow STP to shuffle 
(relocate) 10 loaded MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System 
on the ISFSI pad at the STP ISFSI in January 2025, and load two new 
MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the STP ISFSI in a 
storage condition in March 2025.
    Approval of the exemption request would allow STPNOC to effectively 
manage the margin for full core offload in the STP spent nuclear fuel 
pool to maintain its ability to offload fuel from the reactor and 
account for unplanned outages and cask storage component fabrication 
challenges that could drive rescheduling the loading campaign. It would 
reduce the decay heat removal demand on the spent fuel pool cooling 
system, and thus reduce the consequence of a design basis accident 
associated with a loss of spent fuel pool cooling event and the 
likelihood of a fuel handling accident. Approval of the exemption 
request would also allow

[[Page 53454]]

STPNOC to shuffle already loaded MPC-37-CBS canisters, and thus 
optimize available space on STP ISFSI pad for cask transporter 
maneuverability and minimize long-term damage to the STP ISFSI pad and 
personnel radiation exposure from cask transporter use.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    This EA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting 
an exemption from the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 2. The exemption would allow STPNOC to shuffle 
(relocate) 10 loaded MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System 
on the ISFSI pad at the STP ISFSI in January 2025, and load two new 
MPC-37-CBS in March 2025 in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the 
STP ISFSI in a storage condition.
    The potential environmental impacts of storing spent nuclear fuel 
in NRC-approved storage systems have been documented in previous 
assessments. On July 18, 1990, the NRC amended 10 CFR part 72 to 
provide for the storage of spent nuclear fuel under a general license 
in cask designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final rule 
analyzed the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved 
storage casks. The EA for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 2, published on August 23, 2016, tiers off of the 
EA issued for the July 18, 1990, final rule. ``Tiering'' off earlier 
EAs is a standard process encouraged by the regulations implementing 
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) that entails the 
use of impact analyses of previous EAs to bound the impacts of a 
proposed action where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System is designed to mitigate the effects of design basis accidents 
that could occur during storage. Considering the specific design 
requirements for the accident conditions, the design of the cask would 
prevent loss of containment, shielding, and criticality control. If 
there is no loss of containment, shielding, or criticality control, the 
environmental impacts would not be significant.
    The exemptions requested by STPNOC at the STP site as they relate 
to CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 2, for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System are limited to the use of the CBS variant basket design only for 
shuffling the 10 already loaded canisters and near-term planned loading 
of two canisters utilizing the CBS variant basket design. The staff has 
determined that this change in the basket would not result in either 
radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts that 
significantly differ from the environmental impacts evaluated in the EA 
supporting the issuance of CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 2. If the 
exemption is granted, there would be no significant change in the types 
or amounts of any effluents released, no significant increase in 
individual or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure, and 
no significant increase in the potential for or consequences from 
radiological accidents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that 
there would be no significant environmental impacts associated with the 
proposed action.

Alternative to the Proposed Action

    The staff considered the no-action alternative. The no-action 
alternative (denial of the exemption request) would require STPNOC to 
keep the spent nuclear fuel in the spent fuel pool until the approved 
design canisters can be fabricated and delivered to the site in April 
2025 which is after the planned March 2025 loading campaign. Because 
the March 2025 loading campaign was scheduled, budgeted, and planned 
several years in advance based on planned refueling outages, new fuel 
receipts, and other enterprise-level projects while considering the 
availability of specialty resources (equipment, vendors), any delay 
would have cascading impacts to future new fuel receipt, refueling 
outage, and other enterprise projects. Delay beyond 2025, if unable to 
reschedule in 2025, would result in loading these two canisters during 
the next scheduled loading campaign in 2028. Then, the number of 
canisters to be loaded could increase even more based on the new 
criticality analysis for the spent fuel pools to accommodate the 
planned use of accident tolerant fuel.
    Further, if STPNOC does not shuffle the 10 loaded canisters, this 
could challenge the cask transporter maneuverability on the STP ISFSI 
pad, and thus increase the use of a cask transporter on the STP ISFSI 
pad, which could increase the long-term damage to the STP ISFSI pad and 
result in likely longer personnel radiation exposure from increased 
transporter use.
    The NRC has determined that these potential impacts of the no-
action alternative could be avoided by proceeding with the proposed 
exemption, especially given that the staff has concluded in NRC's 
Safety Determination Memorandum, issued with respect to the enforcement 
action against Holtec regarding these violations, that fuel can be 
stored safely in the MPC-37-CBS canisters.

Agencies Consulted

    The NRC provided the Texas Department of State Health Services 
(TDSHS) a copy of this draft EA for review by an email dated June 3, 
2024. On June 18, 2024, the TDSHS provided its concurrence by email.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action have been reviewed 
in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement 
NEPA. Based upon the foregoing EA, the NRC finds that the proposed 
action of granting the exemption from the regulations in 10 CFR 
72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11) and 72.214, 
which require the licensee to comply with the terms, conditions, and 
specifications of the CoC, would not significantly impact the quality 
of the human environment. The exemption in this case would be limited 
to the shuffling and near-term loading of specific canisters with the 
CBS variant basket design. Accordingly, the NRC has determined that a 
FONSI is appropriate, and an environmental impact statement is not 
warranted.

Attachment--Confirmatory Order

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

In the Matter of: Curium US LLC, Docket No. 030-00001, License No. 24-
04206-01, EA-21-055

Confirmatory Order Modifying License (Effective Upon Issuance)

I

    Curium US LLC holds Materials License No. 24-04206-01 issued on May 
18, 2023 (Amendment No. 105), by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC or Commission) pursuant to Part 30 of Title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR). At the time of the events that led to the 
NRC's October 2019 reactive inspection, Curium conducted operations 
under Amendment 99 of License No. 24-04206-01, which was issued on July 
2, 2019. The license authorizes the use of byproduct material, as 
described in the application dated December 22, 2011, in accordance 
with conditions specified in the license.
    This Confirmatory Order is the result of an agreement reached 
during an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mediation session 
conducted on March 5-6, 2024, in Lisle, Illinois.

II

    On October 29-30, 2019, the NRC conducted a reactive inspection 
with continued in-office review through December 21, 2023. On January 
11, 2024, the NRC issued Inspection Report 03000001/2019003 to Curium 
US LLC which documented the identification of 10 apparent violations 
that occurred at the Maryland Heights, Missouri facility as the result 
of a contamination event on August 19, 2019. The apparent violations 
were being considered for escalated enforcement action in accordance 
with the NRC Enforcement Policy. The apparent violations involved the 
failure to: (1) report, within 24 hours of discovery, an event that 
involved loss of control of licensed material that caused the release 
of radioactive material, so that, had an individual been present for 24 
hours in the area, the individual could have received an intake in 
excess of one occupational annual limit on intake, as required by 10 
CFR 20.2202(b)(2); (2) notify the NRC within 24 hours after the 
discovery of an unplanned contamination event as required by 10 CFR 
30.50(b)(1); (3) assess dose to determine the compliance with 
occupational dose equivalent limits by taking suitable and timely 
measurements of concentrations of radioactive materials in air in the 
work area, quantities of radionuclides in the body, or quantities of 
radionuclides

[[Page 53456]]

excreted from the body as required by 10 CFR 20.1204(a); (4) conduct an 
adequate survey to ensure compliance with limits on licensed material 
released into sanitary sewerage, as required by 10 CFR 20.1501 and 10 
CFR 20.2003(a)(2); (5) furnish dose information to an individual as 
required by 10 CFR 19.13(b)(1); (6) maintain records of surveys as 
required by 10 CFR 20.2103(a); (7) provide information to the 
Commission that is complete and accurate in all material respects as 
required by 10 CFR 30.9; (8) maintain Curium's Corrective Action 
Program as required by License Condition 18; (9) comply with the terms 
and conditions of the Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 9320 as 
required by 10 CFR 71.71(c)(2); and (10) implement Curium's standard 
operating procedure (SOP) for performing personal contamination surveys 
as required by License Condition 21.
    By letter dated January 11, 2024, the NRC provided Curium with a 
reactive inspection report with the opportunity to: (1) request a 
Predecisional Enforcement Conference (PEC); or (2) request ADR.
    In response to the NRC's offer, Curium requested the use of the 
NRC's ADR process to resolve differences it had with the NRC. On March 
5-6, 2024, the NRC and Curium met in an ADR session mediated by a 
professional mediator, arranged through Cornell University's Institute 
on Conflict Resolution. The ADR process is one in which a neutral 
mediator, with no decision-making authority, assists the parties in 
reaching an agreement on resolving any differences regarding the 
dispute. The Confirmatory Order is issued pursuant to the agreement 
reached during the ADR process.

III

    During the ADR session, Curium and the NRC reached a preliminary 
settlement in an Agreement in Principle, which is reproduced in full 
below:

becomes contaminated.
    3. The Health Physics department will send out periodic safety 
messages, at least quarterly, to the facility regarding current 
radiation safety topics for two years starting on the effective date of 
the CO.

F. Internal Dose Assessment and Updated Dose Records

    1. Within 180 days of the effective date of the CO, Curium will 
contract with an independent consultant to complete an internal dose 
assessment for the individual who was involved in the August 19, 2019, 
contamination event (the ``affected individual'').
    a. Prior to entering into a contract with an independent 
consultant, Curium will provide the consultant's qualifications to the 
NRC for review to verify the consultant's independence and 
qualifications.
    b. Curium will provide the consultant with a complete copy of 
Investigation of Incident Report 19-0088, including attachments, for 
use in conducting the assessment.
    c. The independent consultant will provide Curium with a written 
report that includes the estimated internal dose to the affected 
individual and a description of the methods and assumptions used to 
perform the dose calculations. Curium will make the written report 
available to the NRC upon request.
    2. Within 90 days of completion of the internal dose assessment, 
Curium's Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) will (a) review the written 
report and decide whether the estimated dose is reasonable, and (b) 
present the results of the assessment to the Maryland Heights 
facility's Radiation Safety Committee (RSC).
    3. The RSO's decision and RSC's views will be documented in the 
minutes of the RSC. If the RSC or the RSO disagree with the independent 
dose assessment, the basis for the disagreement will be explained in 
the minutes of the RSC. Curium will make the minutes of the RSC 
available to the NRC upon request.
    4. Curium will provide an updated NRC Form 5 for the affected 
individual as appropriate.

G. Sharing Operating Experience

    1. Within one year of the effective date of the CO, Curium will 
offer to make a presentation on the 2019 contamination event and 
management of the response to one national organization, including 
local chapters, whose membership comprises health physics and radiation 
professionals (e.g., the Health Physics Society, Society of Nuclear 
Medicine, or the American Nuclear Society). If the presentation is 
accepted, Curium will designate an appropriate person to make the 
presentation. Curium will inform the NRC at least a month in advance of 
the date and location.

[[Page 53460]]

    2. Curium will provide the slides for the presentation to the NRC 
upon request.

H. Building 500 Evaluation

    1. Within 180 days of the effective date of the CO, Curium will 
evaluate the Building 500 facilities at its Maryland Heights, Missouri, 
location based on Curium's assessment that the facilities in Building 
500 are not appropriate for cask cleaning activities other than wipe 
downs, as stated on pages 16 and 17 of Curium's Investigation of 
Incident Report No. 19-0088.
    2. Curium will document the evaluation and develop and implement 
appropriate corrective actions, if necessary, to provide sufficient 
radiation protection measures for the cask cleaning activities 
conducted in Building 500.

I. Sanitary Sewage

    1. Within 180 days of the effective date of the CO, Curium will 
revise SOP 33-141 (the procedure for responding to a contamination 
event) to establish a process for assessing any discharge of 
radioactive material into the public sanitary sewer system to ensure 
compliance with regulatory requirements. The revised procedure will 
require that the results of this assessment will be documented.
    2. Curium will make the revised procedure available to the NRC upon 
request.
    This agreement is binding upon successors and assigns of Curium US 
LLC. The Regional Administrator, Region III may, in writing, relax or 
rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration of good cause by 
Curium or its successors.

VI

    In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR 2.309, any person 
adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order, other than Curium, may 
request a hearing within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of 
issuance of this Confirmatory Order. Where good cause is shown, 
consideration will be given to extending the time to request a hearing. 
A request for extension of time must be made in writing to the 
Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555, and include a statement of good cause for the 
extension.
    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a 
request for hearing, a petition for leave to intervene, any motion or 
other document filed in the proceeding prior to the submission of a 
request for hearing or petition to intervene (hereinafter 
``petition''), and documents filed by interested governmental entities 
participating under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with 
the NRC's E-Filing rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562, August 3, 2012). The E-Filing process requires participants 
to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the internet, or in 
some cases to mail copies on electronic storage media. Participants may 
not submit paper copies of their filings unless they seek an exemption 
in accordance with the procedures described below.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this 
proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic 
docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. Once a participant has obtained a 
digital ID certificate and a docket has been created, the participant 
can then submit adjudicatory documents. Submissions must be in Portable 
Document Format (PDF). Additional guidance on PDF submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the due date. Upon receipt of 
a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email notice confirming receipt of the document. The 
E-Filing system also distributes an email notice that provides access 
to the document to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any 
others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to 
participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the 
document on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and 
other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for 
and receive a digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are 
filed so that they can obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing 
system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at http://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding government 
holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have a good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted by: (1) first class mail 
addressed to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: 
Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff; or (2) courier, express mail, or 
expedited delivery service to the Office of the Secretary, Sixteenth 
Floor, One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 
20852, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff. Participants 
filing a document in this manner are responsible for serving the 
document on all other participants. Filing is considered complete by 
first-class mail as of the time of deposit in the mail, or by courier, 
express mail, or expedited delivery service upon depositing the 
document with the provider of the service. A presiding officer, having 
granted an exemption request from using E-Filing, may require a 
participant or party to use E-Filing if the presiding officer 
subsequently determines that the reason for granting the exemption from 
use of E-Filing no longer exists.
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is available to the public at 
http://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
Commission or the presiding officer. Participants are requested not to 
include personal privacy information, such as social security numbers, 
home addresses, or

[[Page 53461]]

home phone numbers in their filings, unless an NRC regulation or other 
law requires submission of such information. With respect to 
copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose 
of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use 
application, participants are requested not to include copyrighted 
materials in their submission.
    The Commission will issue a notice or order granting or denying a 
hearing request or intervention petition, designating the issues for 
any hearing that will be held and designating the Presiding Officer. A 
notice granting a hearing will be published in the Federal Register and 
served on the parties to the hearing.
    If a person (other than Curium) requests a hearing, that person 
shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is 
adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order and shall address the 
criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.309(d) and (f).
    If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely 
affected, the Commission will issue an order designating the time and 
place of any hearings. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered 
at such hearing shall be whether this Confirmatory Order should be 
sustained.
    In the absence of any request for hearing, or written approval of 
an extension of time in which to request a hearing, the provisions 
specified in Section V above shall be final 30 days from the date of 
this Confirmatory Order without further order or proceedings. If an 
extension of time for requesting a hearing has been approved, the 
provisions specified in Section V shall be final when the extension 
expires if a hearing request has not been received.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

[NRC-2024-0041]
RIN 3150-AL08


List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Holtec International 
HI-STORM 100 Cask System, Certificate of Compliance No. 1014, Renewed 
Amendment No. 16

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Direct final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its 
spent fuel storage regulations by revising the Holtec International HI-
STORM 100 Cask System listing within the ``List of approved spent fuel 
storage casks'' to include Renewed Amendment No. 16 to Certificate of 
Compliance No. 1014. Renewed Amendment No. 16 revises the certificate 
of compliance to add a new overpack, include the ability to use 
computational fluid dynamics analysis to evaluate site-specific 
accident scenarios, modify the cask design, modify operational and 
testing requirements, and make changes to the final safety analysis 
report.

DATES: This direct final rule is effective September 9, 2024, unless 
significant adverse comments are received by July 25, 2024. If this 
direct final rule is withdrawn as a result of such comments, timely 
notice of the withdrawal will be published in the Federal Register. 
Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical 
to do so, but the NRC is able to ensure consideration only for comments 
received on or before this date. Comments received on this direct final 
rule will also be considered to be comments on a companion proposed 
rule published in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the 
Federal Register.

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    This rule is limited to changes contained in Renewed Amendment No. 
16 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1014 and does not include other 
aspects of the HI-STORM 100 Cask System design. The NRC is using the 
``direct final rule procedure'' to issue this amendment because it 
represents a limited and routine change to an existing certificate of 
compliance that is expected to be non-controversial. Adequate 
protection of public health and safety continues to be reasonably 
assured. The amendment to the rule will become effective on September 
9, 2024. However, if the NRC receives any significant adverse comment 
on this direct final rule by July 25, 2024, then the NRC will publish a 
document that withdraws this action and will subsequently address the 
comments received in a final rule as a response to the companion 
proposed rule published in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of 
the Federal Register or as otherwise appropriate. In general, absent 
significant modifications to the proposed revisions requiring 
republication, the NRC will not initiate a second comment period on 
this action.
    A significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and significant if:
    (1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient 
to require a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For 
example, a substantive response is required when:
    (a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its 
position or conduct additional analysis;
    (b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response to clarify or complete the record; or
    (c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously 
addressed or considered by the NRC.
    (2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and 
it is apparent that the rule would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without incorporation of the change or addition.
    (3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than 
editorial) to the rule, certificate of compliance, or technical 
specifications.

III. Background

    Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
requires that ``[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy] shall 
establish a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear 
power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more 
technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, 
approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional 
site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section 133 of the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act states, in part, that ``[t]he Commission shall, by 
rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved 
by the Commission under Section 219(a) [sic: 218(a)] for use at the 
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''
    To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks under a general license by 
publishing a final rule that added a new subpart K in part 72 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 
29181; July 18, 1990). This rule also established a new subpart L in 10 
CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' which 
contains procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of spent 
fuel storage cask designs. The NRC subsequently issued a final rule on 
May 1, 2000 (65 FR 25241), that approved the HI-STORM 100 Cask System 
design and added it to the list of NRC-approved cask designs in Sec.  
72.214 as Certificate of Compliance No. 1014.

IV. Discussion of Changes

    On March 9, 2021, Holtec International submitted a request to the 
NRC to amend Certificate of Compliance No. 1014 for the HI-STORM 100 
Cask System. Holtec International supplemented its request on the 
following dates: August 11, 2021, August 31, 2022, September 9, 2022, 
October 3, 2022, January 4, 2023, January 5, 2023, January 13, 2023, 
March 17, 2023, and September 20, 2023. On February 17, 2022, Holtec 
International requested to remove the certificate of compliance (CoC) 
reorganization, also known as graded approach, from this amendment.\1\ 
The Renewed Amendment No. 16 revises the certificate of compliance to:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ On May 6, 2021, Holtec submitted a request for Amendment No. 
16 to CoC No. 1014 (Package ML21126A266, incoming letter ML 
21126A267), which included the CoC reorganization, known as graded 
approach. On February 17, 2022, Holtec requested to remove the 
graded approach from Amendment No. 16 (ML22048C221). Therefore, this 
direct final rule, and its companion proposed rule only address 
Amendment No. 16 to CoC No. 1014, as updated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Add a new unventilated high density (UVH) overpack, HI-
STORM 100 UVH, which includes high density concrete for shielding. The 
UVH is to be used with the MPC-32M and MPC-68M.
     Include the ability to use the computational fluid 
dynamics (CFD) analysis to evaluate site-specific fire accident 
scenario.
     Modify the vent and drain penetrations to include the 
option of a second port cover plate.
     Include the ability to use CFD analysis to evaluate site-
specific burial under debris accident scenario.
     Include the ability to use water without glycol in the HI-
TRAC water jacket during transfer operations below 32 [deg]F based on 
the site-specific MPC total heat loads.
     Change the hydrostatic pressure test of the MPC acceptance 
criteria to be examination for leakage only.
     Remove post hydrostatic test liquid penetrant and magnetic 
particle examination.
     Reduce the minimum cooling time for pressurized water 
reactor fuel from 2 years to 1 year.
    Renewed Amendment No. 16 also revises the final safety analysis 
report (FSAR), appendix 1.D, Specification for Plain Concrete in the 
HI-STORM Family of Overpacks, to enhance certain requirements, to add 
certain revised shielding assumptions following a significant thermal 
event, and to add critical characteristics for concrete employed in the 
HI-STORM 100 UVH System. Renewed Amendment No. 16 replaces the fuel 
qualification tables in the FSAR, chapter 2, and in the CoC, including 
the equation for calculation of the maximum allowable burnup as a 
function of the cooling time and cooling time dependent coefficients, 
with simpler sets of burnup and cooling time limits.
    The changes to the aforementioned documents are identified with 
revisions bars in the margin of each document.
    As documented in the preliminary safety evaluation report, the NRC 
performed a safety evaluation of the proposed certificate of compliance 
amendment request. The NRC determined that this amendment does not 
reflect a significant change in design or fabrication of the cask. 
Specifically, the NRC determined that the design of

[[Page 53001]]

the cask would continue to maintain confinement, shielding, and 
criticality control in the event of each evaluated accident condition. 
In addition, any resulting occupational exposure or offsite dose rates 
from the implementation of Renewed Amendment No. 16 would remain well 
within the limits specified by 10 CFR part 20, ``Standards for 
Protection Against Radiation.'' Therefore, the NRC found there will be 
no significant change in the types or amounts of any effluent released, 
no significant increase in the individual or cumulative radiation 
exposure, and no significant increase in the potential for or 
consequences from radiological accidents.
    The NRC staff determined that the amended Holtec International HI-
STORM 100 Cask System cask design, when used under the conditions 
specified in the certificate of compliance, the technical 
specifications, and the NRC's regulations, will meet the requirements 
of 10 CFR part 72; therefore, adequate protection of public health and 
safety will continue to be reasonably assured. When this direct final 
rule becomes effective, persons who hold a general license under Sec.  
72.210 may, consistent with the license conditions under Sec.  72.212, 
load spent nuclear fuel into HI-STORM 100 casks that meet the criteria 
of Renewed Amendment No. 16 of Certificate of Compliance No. 1014.

V. Voluntary Consensus Standards

    The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Pub. 
L. 104-113) requires that Federal agencies use technical standards that 
are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies unless 
the use of such a standard is inconsistent with applicable law or 
otherwise impractical. In this direct final rule, the NRC revises the 
Holtec International HI-STORM 100 Cask System design listed in Sec.  
72.214, ``List of approved spent fuel storage casks.'' This action does 
not constitute the establishment of a standard that contains generally 
applicable requirements.

VI. Agreement State Compatibility

    Under the ``Agreement State Program Policy Statement'' approved by 
the Commission on October 2, 2017, and published in the Federal 
Register on October 18, 2017 (82 FR 48535), this rule is classified as 
Compatibility Category NRC--Areas of Exclusive NRC Regulatory 
Authority. The NRC program elements in this category are those that 
relate directly to areas of regulation reserved to the NRC by the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the provisions of 10 CFR 
chapter I. Therefore, compatibility is not required for program 
elements in this category.

VII. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885).

VIII. Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact

    Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 
and the NRC's regulations in 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection 
Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions,'' 
the NRC has determined that this direct final rule, if adopted, would 
not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of 
the human environment and, therefore, an environmental impact statement 
is not required. The NRC has made a finding of no significant impact on 
the basis of this environmental assessment.

A. The Action

    The action is to amend Sec.  72.214 to revise the Holtec 
International HI-STORM 100 Cask System listing within the ``List of 
approved spent fuel storage casks'' to include Renewed Amendment No. 16 
to Certificate of Compliance No. 1014.

B. The Need for the Action

    This direct final rule amends the certificate of compliance for the 
Holtec International HI-STORM 100 Cask System design within the list of 
approved spent fuel storage casks to allow power reactor licensees to 
store spent fuel at reactor sites in casks with the approved 
modifications under a general license. Specifically, Renewed Amendment 
No. 16 revises the certificate of compliance as follows:
     Add a new UVH overpack, HI-STORM 100 UVH, which includes 
high density concrete for shielding. The UVH is to be used with the 
MPC-32M and MPC-68M.
     Include the ability to use the CFD analysis to evaluate 
site-specific fire accident scenario.
     Modify the vent and drain penetrations to include the 
option of a second port cover plate.
     Include the ability to use CFD analysis to evaluate site-
specific burial under debris accident scenario.
     Include the ability to use water without glycol in the HI-
TRAC water jacket during transfer operations below 32 [deg]F based on 
the site-specific MPC total heat loads.
     Change the hydrostatic pressure test of the MPC acceptance 
criteria to be examination for leakage only. Remove post hydrostatic 
test liquid penetrant and magnetic particle examination.
     Reduce the minimum cooling time for pressurized water 
reactor fuel from 2 years to 1 year.
    Renewed Amendment No. 16 also revises the final safety analysis 
report (FSAR) appendix 1.D, Specification for Plain Concrete in the HI-
STORM Family of Overpacks, to enhance certain requirements, to add 
certain revised shielding assumptions following a significant thermal 
event, and to add critical characteristics for concrete employed in the 
HI-STORM 100 UVH System. Renewed Amendment No. 16 replaces the fuel 
qualification tables in the FSAR, chapter 2, and in the CoC, including 
the equation for calculation of the maximum allowable burnup as a 
function of the cooling time and cooling time dependent coefficients, 
with simpler sets of burnup and cooling time limits.

C. Environmental Impacts of the Action

    On July 18,1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 
CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general 
license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The potential 
environmental impact of using NRC-approved storage casks was analyzed 
in the environmental assessment for the 1990 final rule. The 
environmental assessment for this Renewed Amendment No. 16 tiers off of 
the environmental assessment for the July 18, 1990, final rule. Tiering 
on past environmental assessments is a standard process under the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
    Holtec International HI-STORM 100 Cask System is designed to 
mitigate the effects of design basis accidents that could occur during 
storage. Design basis accidents account for human-induced events and 
the most severe natural phenomena reported for the site and surrounding 
area. Postulated accidents analyzed for an independent spent fuel 
storage installation, the type of facility at which a holder of a power 
reactor operating license would store spent fuel in casks in accordance 
with 10 CFR part 72, can include tornado winds and tornado-generated 
missiles, a design basis earthquake, a design basis flood, an 
accidental cask drop, lightning

[[Page 53002]]

effects, fire, explosions, and other incidents.
    This amendment does not reflect a significant change in design or 
fabrication of the cask. Because there are no significant design or 
process changes, any resulting occupational exposure or offsite dose 
rates from the implementation of Renewed Amendment No. 16 would remain 
well within the 10 CFR part 20 limits. The NRC has also determined that 
the design of the cask as modified by this rule would maintain 
confinement, shielding, and criticality control in the event of an 
accident. Therefore, the proposed changes will not result in any 
radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts that 
significantly differ from the environmental impacts evaluated in the 
environmental assessment supporting the July 18, 1990, final rule. 
There will be no significant change in the types or significant 
revisions in the amounts of any effluent released, no significant 
increase in the individual or cumulative radiation exposures, and no 
significant increase in the potential for, or consequences from, 
radiological accidents. The NRC documented its safety findings in the 
preliminary safety evaluation report.

D. Alternative to the Action

    The alternative to this action is to deny approval of Renewed 
Amendment No. 16 and not issue the direct final rule. Consequently, any 
10 CFR part 72 general licensee that seeks to load spent nuclear fuel 
into Holtec International HI-STORM 100 Cask System in accordance with 
the changes described in proposed Renewed Amendment No. 16 would have 
to request an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212 and 
72.214. Under this alternative, interested licensees would have to 
prepare, and the NRC would have to review, a separate exemption 
request, thereby increasing the administrative burden upon the NRC and 
the costs to each licensee. The environmental impacts would be the same 
as the proposed action.

E. Alternative Use of Resources

    Approval of Renewed Amendment No. 16 to Certificate of Compliance 
No. 1014 would result in no irreversible commitment of resources.

F. Agencies and Persons Contacted

    No agencies or persons outside the NRC were contacted in connection 
with the preparation of this environmental assessment.

G. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the action have been reviewed under 
the requirements in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as 
amended, and the NRC's regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, 
``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions.'' Based on the foregoing environmental 
assessment, the NRC concludes that this direct final rule, ``List of 
Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: Holtec International HI-STORM 100 
Cask System, Certificate of Compliance No. 1014, Renewed Amendment No. 
16,'' will not have a significant effect on the human environment. 
Therefore, the NRC has determined that an environmental impact 
statement is not necessary for this direct final rule.

IX. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement

    This direct final rule does not contain any new or amended 
collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing collections of information were 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150-
0132.

Public Protection Notification

    The NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a request for information or an information collection 
requirement unless the requesting document displays a currently valid 
Office of Management and Budget control number.

X. Regulatory Flexibility Certification

    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the 
NRC certifies that this direct final rule will not, if issued, have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
This direct final rule affects only nuclear power plant licensees and 
Holtec International. These entities do not fall within the scope of 
the definition of small entities set forth in the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act or the size standards established by the NRC (Sec.  
2.810).

XI. Regulatory Analysis

    On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 
CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent nuclear fuel under a 
general license in cask designs approved by the NRC. Any nuclear power 
reactor licensee can use NRC-approved cask designs to store spent 
nuclear fuel if (1) it notifies the NRC in advance; (2) the spent fuel 
is stored under the conditions specified in the cask's certificate of 
compliance; and (3) the conditions of the general license are met. A 
list of NRC-approved cask designs is contained in Sec.  72.214. On May 
31, 2000 (65 FR 25241), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 CFR part 72 
that approved the HI-STORM 100 Cask System by adding it to the list of 
NRC-approved cask designs in Sec.  72.214.
    March 9, 2021, as supplemented on August 11, 2021, August 31, 2022, 
September 9, 2022, October 3, 2022, January 4, 2023, January 5, 2023, 
January 13, 2023, March 17, 2023, and September 20, 2023, Holtec 
International submitted a request to amend the HI-STORM 100 Cask System 
as described in Section IV, ``Discussion of Changes,'' of this 
document.
    The alternative to this action is to withhold approval of Renewed 
Amendment No. 16 and to require any 10 CFR part 72 general licensee 
seeking to load spent nuclear fuel into Holtec International HI-STORM 
100 Cask System under the changes described in Renewed Amendment No. 16 
to request an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212 and 
72.214. Under this alternative, each interested 10 CFR part 72 licensee 
would have to prepare, and the NRC would have to review, a separate 
exemption request, thereby increasing the administrative burden upon 
the NRC and the costs to each licensee.
    Approval of this direct final rule is consistent with previous NRC 
actions. Further, as documented in the preliminary safety evaluation 
report and environmental assessment, this direct final rule will have 
no adverse effect on public health and safety or the environment. This 
direct final rule has no significant identifiable impact or benefit on 
other government agencies. Based on this regulatory analysis, the NRC 
concludes that the requirements of this direct final rule are 
commensurate with the NRC's responsibilities for public health and 
safety and the common defense and security. No other available 
alternative is believed to be as satisfactory; therefore, this action 
is recommended.

XII. Backfitting and Issue Finality

    The NRC has determined that the backfit rule (Sec.  72.62) does not 
apply to this direct final rule. Therefore, a backfit analysis is not 
required. This direct final rule revises Certificate of Compliance No. 
1014 for the Holtec International HI-STORM 100 Cask System, as 
currently listed in Sec.  72.214. The revision consists of the changes 
in Renewed Amendment No. 16 previously

[[Page 53003]]

described, as set forth in the revised certificate of compliance and 
technical specifications.
    Renewed Amendment No. 16 to Certificate of Compliance No. 1014 for 
the Holtec International HI-STORM 100 Cask System was initiated by 
Holtec International and was not submitted in response to new NRC 
requirements, or an NRC request for amendment. Renewed Amendment No. 16 
applies only to new casks fabricated and used under Renewed Amendment 
No. 16. These changes do not affect existing users of the Holtec 
International HI-STORM 100 Cask System, and the current Amendment No. 
15 continues to be effective for existing users. While current users of 
this storage system may comply with the new requirements in Renewed 
Amendment No. 16, this would be a voluntary decision on the part of 
current users.
    For these reasons, Renewed Amendment No. 16 to Certificate of 
Compliance No. 1014 does not constitute backfitting under Sec.  72.62 
or Sec.  50.109(a)(1), or otherwise represent an inconsistency with the 
issue finality provisions applicable to combined licenses in 10 CFR 
part 52. Accordingly, the NRC has not prepared a backfit analysis for 
this rulemaking.

XIII. Congressional Review Act

    This direct final rule is not a rule as defined in the 
Congressional Review Act.

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    Because the NRC considers this action to be non-controversial, the 
NRC is publishing this proposed rule concurrently with a direct final 
rule in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal 
Register. The direct final rule will become effective on September 9, 
2024. However, if the NRC receives any significant adverse comment by 
July 25, 2024, then the NRC will publish a document that withdraws the 
direct final rule. If the direct final rule is withdrawn, the NRC will 
address the comments in a subsequent final rule. In general, absent 
significant modifications to the proposed revisions requiring 
republication, the NRC will

[[Page 53036]]

not initiate a second comment period on this action in the event the 
direct final rule is withdrawn.
    A significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and significant if:
    (1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient 
to require a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For 
example, a substantive response is required when:
    (a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its 
position or conduct additional analysis;
    (b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response to clarify or complete the record; or
    (c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously 
addressed or considered by the NRC.
    (2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and 
it is apparent that the rule would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without incorporation of the change or addition.
    (3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than 
editorial) to the rule.
    For a more detailed discussion of the proposed rule changes and 
associated analyses, see the direct final rule published in the Rules 
and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register.

III. Background

    Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
requires that ``[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy] shall 
establish a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear 
power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more 
technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, 
approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional 
site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section 133 of the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act states, in part, that ``[t]he Commission shall, by 
rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved 
by the Commission under Section 219(a) [sic: 218(a)] for use at the 
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''
    To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks under a general license by 
publishing a final rule that added a new subpart K in part 72 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 
29181; July 18, 1990). This rule also established a new subpart L in 10 
CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' which 
contains procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of spent 
fuel storage cask designs. The NRC subsequently issued a final rule on 
May 1, 2000 (65 FR 25241) that approved the HI-STORM 100 Cask System 
design and added it to the list of NRC-approved cask designs in Sec.  
72.214 as Certificate of Compliance No. 1014.

IV. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885). The NRC requests comment on the proposed rule with respect to 
clarity and effectiveness of the language used.

II. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of amendments to Renewed Facility 
Operating License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85 (Docket Nos. 50-352 and 50-
353, respectively) issued to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC for 
operation of the Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, located in 
Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.
    The proposed amendments would revise the technical specifications 
for detecting and responding to leakage in the turbine enclosure main 
steam line tunnel. The proposed amendments would delete turbine 
enclosure main steam line tunnel temperature requirements from various 
instrumentation-related technical specifications and add a new 
specification to verify there is no leakage from the main steam line 
pressure boundary when the turbine enclosure main steam line tunnel 
temperature exceeds a certain value.
    Before issuance of the proposed license amendments, the NRC will 
need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and NRC's regulations.
    The NRC has made a proposed determination that the license 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under 
the NRC's regulations in section 50.92 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Issuance of amendment,'' this means 
that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed 
amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction 
in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has 
provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards 
consideration, which is presented as follows:

[[Page 53125]]

    1. Do the proposed amendments involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed changes do not alter any of the previously evaluated 
accidents in the UFSAR [updated final safety analysis report]. The 
proposed changes do not affect any of the initiators of previously 
evaluated accidents in a manner that would increase the likelihood of 
the event. The proposed change also eliminates the automatic MSIV [main 
steam isolation valve] isolation function associated with TE [turbine 
enclosure] MSL [main steam line] Tunnel high temperature from the 
requirements of the Technical Specifications (TS) and creates TS 
requirements for TE MSL tunnel temperature monitoring in a new TS \3/
4\.7.9.
    Automatic isolation of the MSIVs on TE MSL tunnel high temperature 
is not an initiator of any accident previously evaluated. A manual 
plant shutdown initiated due to MSL leakage in the TE MSL tunnel is not 
an initiator of any accident previously evaluated. There is no credit 
taken in any licensing basis analysis for MSIV closure on TE MSL tunnel 
high temperature, and there are no calculations that credit the subject 
isolation function as a mitigative feature.
    As a result, the likelihood of malfunction of an SSC [structure, 
system, and component] is not increased. The capability and operation 
of the mitigation systems are not affected by the proposed changes. 
Thus, the mitigating systems will continue to be initiated and mitigate 
the consequences of an accident as assumed in the analysis of accidents 
previously evaluated.
    Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated.
    2. Do the proposed amendments create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed changes will not introduce any new operating modes, 
safety-related equipment lineups, accident scenarios, system 
interactions, or failure modes that would create a new or different 
type of accident. Failure(s) of the system will have the same effect as 
the present design.
    The proposed change also eliminates the automatic MSIV isolation 
function associated with TE MSL Tunnel high temperature from the 
requirements of the TS and creates TS requirements for TE MSL tunnel 
temperature monitoring in a new TS 3/4.7.9. Eliminating the automatic 
isolation of the MSIVs will not create a new or different kind of 
accident from those previously evaluated as a Main Steam Line Break has 
been evaluated. Elimination of the automatic isolation function will 
not create a new failure mechanism as a plant shutdown continues to be 
required if an MSL leak is detected.
    The proposed change from an automatic shutdown to a manual shutdown 
will not create any credible new failure mechanisms, malfunctions, or 
accident initiators not considered in the design and licensing bases. 
The unlikely failure to manually detect an MSL leak and shutdown the 
plant and that failure leading to a Main Steam Line Break has already 
been evaluated and is not a new type of accident.
    Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a 
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated.
    3. Do the proposed amendments involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety?
    Response: No.
    The proposed changes do not affect the accident source term, 
containment isolation, or radiological release assumptions used in 
evaluating the radiological consequences of any accident previously 
evaluated and are consistent with safety analysis assumptions and 
resultant consequences. The proposed changes do not impact reactor 
operating parameters or the functional requirements of the affected 
instrumentation systems. These systems will continue to provide the 
design basis reactor trips and protective system actuations. All design 
basis events, and the reliance on the reactor trips and protective 
system actuations will remain unchanged. No controlling numerical 
values for parameters established in the UFSAR or the license or Safety 
Limits are affected by the proposed changes.
    Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant 
reduction in a margin of safety.
    The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on 
this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration.
    The NRC is seeking public comments on this proposed determination 
that the license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue the license amendment before expiration of the 60-
day notice period if the Commission concludes the amendment involves no 
significant hazards consideration. In addition, the Commission may 
issue the amendment prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment 
period if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such 
that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in 
derating or shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action 
prior to the expiration of either the comment period or the notice 
period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. 
If the Commission makes a final no significant hazards consideration 
determination, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very 
infrequently.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that

[[Page 53126]]

the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, 
the Commission may issue the amendment and make it immediately 
effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would 
take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination 
is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards 
consideration, then any hearing held would take place before the 
issuance of the amendment unless the Commission finds an imminent 
danger to the health or safety of the public, in which case it will 
issue an appropriate order or rule under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions and E-Filing

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    For further details with respect to this action, see the 
application for license amendment dated June 13, 2024 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24165A264).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    During the period from May 1, 2024, to May 31, 2024, the NRC 
granted two exemptions in response to requests submitted by the 
following licensees: Dairyland Power Cooperative; and Portland General 
Electric Company.
    These exemptions temporarily allow the licensee to deviate from 
certain requirements of part 73 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,'' 
subpart T, ``Security Notifications, Reports, and Recordkeeping.'' In 
support of their exemption requests, the licensees agreed to effect 
site-specific administrative controls that maintain the approach to 
complying with 10 CFR part 73 in effect prior to the NRC's issuance of 
a final rule, ``Enhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and 
Security Event Notifications,'' which was published in the Federal 
Register on March 14, 2023, and became effective on April 13, 2023 (88 
FR 15864).

II. Availability of Documents

    The tables in this notice provide transparency regarding the number 
and type of exemptions the NRC has issued and provide the facility 
name, docket number, document description, document date, and ADAMS

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC received a subsequent license renewal application (SLRA) 
from CEG, dated April 17, 2024 (ADAMS Package Accession No. 
ML24108A007), filed pursuant to section 103 of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended (the Act), and part 54 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Requirements for Renewal of Operating 
Licenses for Nuclear Power Plants,'' requesting the renewal of the 
operating licenses for Dresden, Units 2 and 3, at 2,957 megawatts 
thermal for each unit. The Dresden units are boiling-water reactors 
located in Morris, Illinois. A notice of receipt of the SLRA was 
published in the Federal Register on May 7, 2024, (89 FR 38197).
    The NRC staff has determined that CEG has submitted sufficient 
information in accordance with 10 CFR 54.19, 54.21, 54.22, 54.23, 
51.45, and 51.53(c), to enable the staff to undertake a review of the 
application, and that the application is, therefore, acceptable for 
docketing. The current docket nos. 50-237 and 50-249 for the Renewed 
Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-19 and DPR-25 will be retained. The 
determination to accept the SLRA for docketing does not constitute a 
determination that a subsequent renewed license should be issued and 
does not preclude the NRC staff from requesting additional information 
as the review proceeds.
    Before issuance of the requested subsequent renewed licenses, the 
NRC will have made the findings required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations. In accordance with 10 CFR 54.29, 
the NRC may issue a subsequent renewed license on the basis of its 
review if it finds that actions have been identified and have been or 
will be taken with respect to: (1) managing the effects of aging during 
the period of extended operation on the functionality of structures and 
components that have been identified as requiring aging management 
review; and (2) time-limited aging analyses that have been identified 
as requiring review, such that there is reasonable assurance that the 
activities authorized by the renewed license will continue to be 
conducted in accordance with the current licensing basis and that any 
changes made to the plant's current licensing basis will comply with 
the Act and the Commission's regulations.
    In Florida Power & Light Co. (Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Units 
3 and 4), CLI-22-2 (ADAMS Accession No. ML22055A496), the Commission 
found that 10 CFR 51.53(c)(3), which at the time allowed applicants for 
``initial'' license renewal to rely on the 2013 Generic Environmental 
Impact Statement for License Renewal (GEIS) in their environmental 
reports for ``Category 1'' issues, does not apply to applications for 
subsequent license renewal. The Commission further found that the GEIS 
itself does not describe the environmental impacts of operation during 
the period of subsequent license renewal. In CLI-22-2 the Commission 
found that because the 2013 GEIS did not consider the impacts from 
operations during the subsequent license renewal period, applicants for 
subsequent license renewal must evaluate on a site-specific basis 
``Category 1'' impacts. Separately, in Staff Requirements Memorandum 
(SRM)--SECY--21--0066--Rulemaking Plan for Renewing Nuclear Power Plant 
Operating Licenses--Environmental Review (RIN 3150-AK32; NRC-2018-
0296), dated February 24, 2022, (ADAMS Accession No. ML22053A308), the 
Commission directed the staff to review and update the 2013 GEIS so 
that it covers operation during the subsequent license renewal period.
    In SRM-M240516A: Affirmation Session--SECY-24-0017: Final Rule--
Renewing Nuclear Power Plant Operating Licenses--Environmental Review 
(RIN 3150-AK32; NRC-2018-0296), dated May 16, 2024, (ADAMS Package 
Accession No. ML24137A213), the Commission approved a final rule that 
will amend 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection Regulations for 
Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions'' by, among other 
things, updating Table B-1, ``Summary of Findings on NEPA [National 
Environmental Policy Act] Issues for License Renewal of Nuclear Power 
Plants,'' in appendix B, ``Environmental Effect of Renewing the 
Operating License of a Nuclear Power Plant,'' to 10 CFR part 51, 
subpart A, ``National Environmental Policy Act-Regulations Implementing 
Section 102(2).'' The updates to Table B-1 are supported by the revised 
NUREG-1437, Revision 2, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for 
License Renewal of Nuclear Plants'' (LR GEIS). The updates fully 
account for one term of subsequent license renewal (SLR) by reflecting 
a thorough evaluation of the environmental impacts of SLR in the LR 
GEIS; the staff has also updated associated guidance. Additionally, the 
final rule will remove the word ``initial'' from 10 CFR 51.53(c)(3) and 
make conforming changes in 10 CFR 51.53(c)(3)(ii) and 10 CFR 51.95(c). 
The final Federal Register notice for the updated rule has not yet been 
published. The licensee's environmental report evaluated ``Category 1'' 
impacts via site-specific analyses because the GEIS rulemaking was not 
complete when the licensee submitted its SLR application.

II. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic

[[Page 52516]]

Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. Petitions and 
motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that are filed 
after the deadline will not be entertained absent a determination by 
the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates good cause by 
satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

III. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    Information about the license renewal process can be found under 
the Reactor License Renewal section on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal.html. Copies 
of the application to renew the operating licenses for Dresden, Units 2 
and 3, are available for public inspection at the NRC's PDR, and on the 
NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications.html while the application is under 
review. The application may be accessed in ADAMS through the NRC 
Library on the internet at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Reactor Site Criteria.'' The NRC hereby informs potential respondents 
that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and that a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays 
a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on April 5, 2024, 89 FR 24044.
    1. The title of the information collection: Reactor Site Criteria.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0093.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: As necessary 
in order for the NRC to assess the adequacy of proposed seismic design 
bases and the design bases for other site hazards for small modular 
reactors (SMRs) and/or non-light water reactors (LWRs) constructed and 
licensed in accordance with parts 50 and 52 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Applicants who apply 
for an early site permit (ESP), combined license (COL) or a 
construction permit (CP) or operating license (OL) on or after January 
10, 1997.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 13.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 13.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 482,412 hours.
    10. Abstract: 10 CFR part 100, ``Reactor Site Criteria,'' 
establishes approval requirements for proposed sites for the purpose of 
constructing and operating stationary SMRs and/or non-LWRs. Subpart B, 
``Evaluation Factors for Stationary Power Reactor Site Applications on 
or after January 10, 1997,'' requirements apply to applicants who apply 
for an ESP, COL or a CP or OL on or after January 10, 1997. This 
clearance is necessary since the NRC is expecting approximately 8 SMR 
and/or non-LWR siting applications over the next 3 years. The 
applicants must provide information regarding the physical 
characteristics of the site in addition to the potential for natural 
phenomena and man-made hazards. This includes information on 
meteorological hazards (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, snowfall, and 
extreme temperatures), hydrologic hazards (such as floods, tsunami, and 
seiches) geologic hazards (such as faulting, seismic hazards, and the 
maximum credible earthquake) and factors such as population density, 
the proximity of man-related hazards (e.g., airports, dams, 
transportation routes, military and chemical facilities), and site 
hydrological and atmospheric dispersion characteristics. The NRC staff 
reviews the submitted information and, if necessary, may generate a 
request for additional information. The staff meets with the applicant 
and conducts a site visit to resolve any open issues. When the open 
issues have been resolved, the staff writes the final safety evaluation 
report, which is published and used as a basis for the remainder of the 
NRC licensing process.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 50-213 and 72-39; NRC-2024-0093]


Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company; Haddam Neck Plant; 
Exemption

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued an 
exemption in response to the April 24, 2023, request from Connecticut 
Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO), for the Haddam Neck Plant (HNP or 
Haddam Neck) located in East Hampton, Connecticut. The exemption 
permits CYAPCO to make withdrawals from a separate account within 
CYAPCO's overall nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT), on an annual 
basis, for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and Greater than Class C (GTCC) 
waste management and non-radiological site restoration without prior 
notification to the NRC.

DATES: The exemption was issued on May 30, 2024.

ADDRESSES: Please refer to Docket ID NRC-2024-0093 when contacting the 
NRC about the availability of information regarding this document. You 
may obtain publicly available information related to this document 
using any of the following methods:

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tilda Liu, Office of Nuclear Material 
Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, 
DC 20555-0001; telephone: 404-997-4730; email: [email protected].

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By letter dated April 24, 2023 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML23130A118), CYAPCO submitted a request to the NRC for 
an exemption from paragraphs 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) for the HNP Independent 
Spent Fuel Storage Installation \1\ (ISFSI).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As discussed in this document, the Haddam Neck ISFSI sits on 
the former site of HNP, which CYAPCO finished decommissioning in 
2007. Although only the Haddam Neck ISFSI remains on the site, 
CYAPCO's 10 CFR part 50 license, Facility Operating License No. DPR-
61 remains in effect. Because CYAPCO requested an exemption from the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 50, this would be an exemption for 
CYAPCO's 10 CFR part 50 license rather than for CYAPCO's 10 CFR part 
72 general license. Therefore, although CYAPCO's submission 
requested an exemption for the Haddam Neck ISFSI, the NRC staff 
considers it a request for an exemption for HNP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CYAPCO has established a separate (segregated) account within its 
over-arching NDT, entitled ``ISFSI Radiological Decom,'' that 
identifies the funds for radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI 
apart from the larger balance of funds in the NDT allocated for ongoing 
management of SNF and GTCC waste and for non-radiological site 
restoration activities. Although 10 CFR 50.82 applies to the segregated 
account, it does not apply to the overall NDT.
    The exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) allows 
CYAPCO to make withdrawals from the segregated account, on an annual 
basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site 
restoration without prior notification to the NRC. More specifically, 
with this exemption, CYAPCO can annually transfer funds exceeding 110 
percent of the inflation-adjusted Decommissioning Cost Estimate, 
described in 10 CFR 50.75, from the segregated account to its 
overarching NDT and use those funds for SNF and GTCC waste management 
and non-radiological site restoration.
    Based on the review, the NRC determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue 
risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common 
defense and security. Also, the NRC determined that special 
circumstances, consistent with 10 CFR 50.12(a)(ii) and (iii), are 
present. Therefore, the NRC granted CYAPCO an exemption from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) to 
permit CYAPCO to make withdrawals from the segregated account, on an 
annual basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological 
site restoration without prior notification to the NRC. All other 
relevant requirements shall be met. On May 30, 2024, the NRC issued an 
exemption for CYAPCO (ADAMS Package Accession No. ML24099A196). The NRC 
staff also prepared an environmental assessment and finding of no 
significant impact regarding the proposed exemption request, published 
in the Federal Register on May 28, 2024 (89 FR 46170), and concluded 
that the proposed exemption would not have a significant impact on the 
quality of the human environment.

    Dated: June 11, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Yoira Diaz-Sanabria,
Chief, Storage and Transportation Licensing Branch, Division of Fuel 
Management, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated March 28, 2024 (ADAMS Package Accession No. 
ML24088A059), TerraPower, LLC (TerraPower) on behalf of US SFR Owner, 
LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of TerraPower, submitted to the NRC 
pursuant to Section 103 of the Atomic Energy Act and part 50 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities,'' an application for a CP to 
construct a Natrium Reactor Plant, Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1, in 
Lincoln County, Wyoming as part of participation in the U.S. Department 
of Energy's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. The Natrium

[[Page 49918]]

Reactor Plant is an 840 megawatts thermal, pool type, sodium-cooled 
fast reactor that contains a compact and simple safety envelope and a 
molten salt energy storage system. This submission initiated the NRC's 
proposed action of determining whether to grant the CP. The application 
was supplemented on May 2, 2024 (ADAMS Accession Nos. ML24123A242, 
ML24123A243) and May 9, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24130A181). A 
notice of receipt and availability of the application, was published in 
the Federal Register (FR) on May 14, 2024 (89 FR 42004).
    The NRC staff determined that TerraPower submitted an application 
in accordance with 10 CFR part 50, and that the application is 
acceptable for docketing under Docket No. 50-0613. The NRC sent a 
letter of acceptance and docketing to TerraPower on May 21, 2024 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML24135A109). A notice of acceptance for docketing of the 
application and notice of hearing were published in the FR on June 4, 
2024 (89 FR 47997). These notices are available on the Federal 
rulemaking website (https://www.regulations.gov) by searching for 
Docket ID NRC-2024-0078.

III. Request for Comment

    This notice informs the public of the NRC's intent to conduct 
environmental scoping and prepare an EIS related to the CP application 
for Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 and to provide the public an 
opportunity to participate in the environmental scoping process, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.29 ``Scoping-environmental impact statement 
and supplement to environmental impact statement,'' and 10 CFR 51.116 
``Notice of intent.''
    The regulations in 36 CFR 800.8, ``Coordination with the National 
Environmental Policy Act,'' allow agencies to use their National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) (NEPA) 
process to fulfill the requirements of Section 106 of the National 
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 U.S.C. 300101, et seq.) (NHPA). 
Therefore, pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8(c), the NRC intends to use its 
process and documentation required for the preparation of the EIS on 
the proposed action to comply with Section 106 of the NHPA in lieu of 
the procedures set forth at 36 CFR 800.3 through 800.6.
    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.50(a), TerraPower submitted an ER as 
part of the CP application. The ER was prepared pursuant to 10 CFR part 
51 and is publicly available at ADAMS Accession No. ML24088A072. The ER 
will also be available for viewing at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/applicant-projects/terrapower.html. In addition, the ER is available for public review at 
the Lincoln County Library, 519 Emerald Street, Kemmerer, WY 83101.
    The NRC intends to gather the information necessary to prepare an 
EIS related to the CP application for the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 
1. The NRC is required by 10 CFR 51.20(b) to prepare an EIS in 
connection with the issuance of a CP for a power reactor. This notice 
is being published in accordance with NEPA and the NRC's regulations at 
10 CFR part 51.
    The EIS will evaluate the environmental impacts of construction, 
operation, and decommissioning of the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1, 
and reasonable alternatives thereto. Possible alternatives to the 
proposed action include the no action alternative and alternative 
sites.
    As part of its environmental review, the NRC will first conduct a 
scoping process and, as soon as practicable thereafter, will prepare a 
draft EIS for public comment. Participation in this scoping process by 
members of the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal government 
agencies is encouraged. The scoping process for the draft EIS will be 
used to accomplish the following:
    a. Define the proposed action that is to be the subject of the EIS;
    b. Determine the scope of the EIS and identify the significant 
issues to be analyzed in depth;
    c. Identify and eliminate from detailed study those issues that are 
peripheral or are not significant or that have been covered by prior 
environmental review;
    d. Identify any environmental assessments and other ElSs that are 
being or will be prepared that are related to, but are not part of, the 
scope of the EIS under consideration;
    e. Identify other environmental review and consultation 
requirements related to the proposed action;
    f. Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation 
of the environmental analyses and the NRC's tentative planning and 
decision-making schedule;
    g. Identify any cooperating agencies and, as appropriate, allocate 
assignments for preparation and schedules for completing the EIS to the 
NRC and any cooperating agencies; and
    h. Describe how the EIS will be prepared, including any contractor 
assistance to be used.
    The NRC invites the following entities to participate in scoping:
    a. The applicant, US SFR Owner, LLC.;
    b. Any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or that is 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    c. Affected State and local government agencies, including those 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    d. Any affected Indian Tribe;
    e. Any person who requests or has requested an opportunity to 
participate in the scoping process; and
    f. Any person who has petitioned or intends to petition for leave 
to intervene under 10 CFR 2.309.

IV. Public Scoping Meeting

    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.26(b), the scoping process for an EIS 
may include a public scoping meeting to help identify significant 
issues related to the proposed action and to determine the scope of 
issues to be addressed in the EIS.
    The NRC is planning to conduct a public scoping meeting for the 
Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 EIS. The meeting is currently expected to 
be held on July 16, 2024. Meeting details will be available by June 25, 
2024, at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-reactors/advanced/who-were-working-with/applicant-projects/terrapower.html or at the NRC's Public 
Meeting Schedule website at https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg. A court 
reporter will transcribe all comments received during the public 
meeting. To be considered, comments must be provided either at the 
transcribed public meeting or in writing, as discussed in the ADDRESSES 
section of this document. Please contact Patricia Vokoun no later than 
July 6, 2024, if accommodations or special equipment is needed to 
participate or to provide comments, so that the NRC staff can determine 
whether the request can be accommodated.
    The public scoping meeting will include: (1) an overview by the NRC 
staff of the safety and environmental review processes, the proposed 
scope of the EIS, and the proposed review schedule; and (2) the 
opportunity for interested government agencies, organizations, and 
individuals to submit comments or suggestions on environmental issues 
or the proposed scope of the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 EIS.
    Participation in the scoping process for the Kemmerer Power Station 
Unit 1 EIS does not entitle participants to become parties to the 
proceeding to which the EIS relates. Matters related to

[[Page 49919]]

participation in any hearing are outside the scope of matters to be 
discussed at this public meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing a revision in the NRC's ``Regulatory Guide'' 
series. This series was developed to describe methods that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the 
agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff uses in 
evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to describe 
information that the staff needs in its review of applications for 
permits and licenses.
    The proposed Revision 1 to RG 1.210 was issued with a temporary 
identification of Draft Regulatory Guide, DG-1412. This revision 
endorses, with clarifications, the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) Standard (Std.) 650-2017, ``IEEE Standard 
for Qualification of Class 1E Static Battery Chargers, Inverters, and 
Uninterruptible Power Supply Systems for Nuclear Power Generating 
Stations.''

II. Additional Information

    The NRC published notice of the availability of DG-1412 in the 
Federal Register on February 1, 2023 (88 FR 6672) for a 30-day public 
comment period. The public comment period closed on March 3, 2023. 
Public comments on DG-1412 and the staff responses to the public 
comments are available in ADAMS under Accession No. ML23202A244.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under chapter 
I of title 1 the Code of the Federal Register (CFR).

III. Congressional Review Act

    This RG is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    RG 1.210, Revision 1, does not constitute backfitting as defined in 
10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC Management 
Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue 
Finality, and Information Requests''; does not constitute forward 
fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 8.4; and does not 
affect the issue finality of an approval issued under 10 CFR part 52. 
As explained in RG 1.210, applicants and licensees are not required to 
comply with the positions set forth in this RG.

V. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses and Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination

    For the facility-specific amendment requests shown in this notice, 
the Commission finds that the licensees' analyses provided, consistent 
with section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) ``Notice for public comment; State consultation,'' are sufficient 
to support the proposed determinations that these amendment requests 
involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, 
operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments 
would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or

[[Page 49239]]

consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves NSHC. In addition, the Commission may issue any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period 
if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that 
failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or 
shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice 
of issuance. If the Commission makes a final NSHC determination for any 
of these amendments, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take action on any amendment before 
60 days have elapsed will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system

[[Page 49240]]

may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic Filing Help Desk 
through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by email to 
[email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-7640. The 
NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., 
ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    The following table provides the plant name, docket number, date of 
application, ADAMS accession number, and location in the application of 
the licensees' proposed NSHC determinations. For further details with 
respect to these license amendment applications, see the applications 
for amendment, which are available for public inspection in ADAMS. For 
additional direction on accessing information related to this document, 
see the ``Obtaining Information and Submitting Comments'' section of 
this document.

III. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Combined Licenses

    During the period since publication of the last monthly notice, the 
Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has 
determined for each of these amendments that the application complies 
with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The 
Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    A notice of consideration of issuance of amendment to facility 
operating license or combined license, as applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing in connection with these 
actions, were published in the Federal Register as indicated in the 
safety evaluation for each amendment.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that 
these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.22(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to each action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession numbers for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

In the Matter of: Mistras Group, Inc, EA-23-105.

[[Page 48198]]

Confirmatory Order

Effective Upon Issuance

I

    Mistras Group, LLC. (Mistras) performs activities such as testing 
of heavy lifting equipment at nuclear power plants licensed by the U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission). Mistras, as 
specified in purchase orders and contracts with NRC licensees, is 
required to implement Appendix B, ``Quality Assurance Criteria for 
Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants,'' of Part 50, 
``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities,'' to 
Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). Mistras' non-
destructive testing (NDT) service includes usage of an Acoustic 
Emission (AE) Data Acquisition System to examine the structural 
integrity of cranes used for lifting components such as reactor vessel 
heads and reactor vessel internals at many NRC licensee sites.
    This Confirmatory Order (CO) is the result of an agreement reached 
during an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mediation session 
conducted on March 21, 2024, in Rockville, Maryland, to address one 
apparent violation.

II

    On October 22, 2021, the NRC's Office of Investigations (OI) opened 
an investigation (OI Case No. 1-2022-003) at Mistras' Trainer, 
Pennsylvania facility. The investigation, which was completed on 
October 19, 2022, and supplemented on May 9, 2023, evaluated whether a 
former Director of Advanced Services and a former NDT engineer engaged 
in deliberate misconduct by falsifying certificates of calibration for 
AE equipment that was used to perform inspections of heavy lifting 
equipment for safety-related components at nuclear power plants.
    Based on the conclusions of the investigation, the NRC's Office of 
Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Division of Reactor Oversight, Quality 
Assurance Vendor Inspection Branch, issued an apparent violation that 
was documented in an NRC letter, dated December 7, 2023 (Agencywide 
Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. 
ML23340A106).
    The apparent violation of 10 CFR 50.5, ``Deliberate misconduct,'' 
stated that from approximately 2011 until 2021, Mistras (a contractor) 
knowingly provided services related to licensees' activities in 10 CFR 
part 50 and deliberately submitted to licensees information that the 
person submitting the information knew to be incomplete or inaccurate 
in some respect material to the NRC. Specifically, Mistras maintained 
falsified records documenting the calibration of test equipment used at 
nuclear power plants. On multiple occasions, two Mistras employees 
created falsified documents to conceal Mistras' failure to calibrate 
the AE Data Acquisition Systems on an annual basis, as specified by the 
equipment manufacturer. These falsified documents, including 
certificates of calibration, were submitted to NRC licensees as part of 
AE test reports on multiple occasions between approximately 2011 and 
2021.
    Additionally, the apparent violation stated that the Mistras AE 
test reports provided by Mistras to licensees (which included the 
falsified certificates of calibration) are material to the NRC. The 
test reports concerned AE systems that were used in activities 
affecting quality (e.g., AE systems were used by NRC licensees to 
examine the structural integrity of cranes used for lifting components 
such as reactor vessel heads and reactor vessel internals), and the 
test reports are quality assurance records in accordance with Appendix 
B, Criterion XVII, ``Quality Assurance Records,'' to 10 CFR part 50, 
which provide evidence that licensees are in compliance with NRC 
regulations.
    When issuing the apparent violation, the NRC provided Mistras an 
opportunity to attend a pre-decisional enforcement conference or 
participate in an ADR mediation session to resolve this concern. In 
response, Mistras requested the use of the NRC's ADR process. On March 
21, 2024, the NRC and Mistras conducted an ADR session mediated by a 
professional mediator, arranged through Cornell University's Scheinman 
Institute on Conflict Resolution. The ADR process is one in which a 
neutral mediator, with no decision-making authority, assists the 
parties in reaching an agreement to resolve any differences regarding 
the dispute. This Confirmatory Order is issued pursuant to the 
agreement reached during the ADR process.

III

    NRC and Mistras reached a preliminary settlement agreement during a 
full-day mediation session that was conducted on March 21, 2024. The 
elements of the agreement include the following:
    1. In recognition of the prompt and corrective actions taken in 
response to the apparent violation, as documented in this CO and 
discussed at the ADR, Mistras is not required to provide a written 
response in accordance with 10 CFR 2.201. Corrective actions completed 
by Mistras prior to the mediation session include, but are not limited 
to, the following:
    a. Individuals responsible for the fraudulent records had their 
employment terminated.
    b. AE instruments were properly calibrated by Physical Acoustics, 
the manufacturer of the equipment.
    c. Developed a web[hyphen]based training course for all employees, 
which included an introduction by the company's Chief Executive 
Officer, to speak about the importance of promoting a culture of 
ethics, and how any deliberate misconduct has consequences, including 
loss of employment and imprisonment.
    d. Local and Corporate Quality Departments reviewed procedures, 
records, and equipment.
    e. AE procedures and forms were adopted into the Corporate Document 
Center, as formal quality assurance records.
    f. AE test equipment was added to the measuring and test equipment 
(M&TE) recall system.
    g. AE program procedures and work instructions were revised to 
clarify the calibration verification instructions and to identify 
future calibration requirements.
    h. Notification letters were written and distributed to notify 
applicable nuclear power plants of the nonconformance associated with 
their equipment.
    i. An interim report and a final 10 CFR part 21 report were 
submitted to the NRC.
    j. Mistras developed or revised the following procedures:
    i. Revised procedure 100-QC-006, ``Contract Review & Project 
Planning'' to ensure that ``Nuclear Projects'' are submitted to the 
Nuclear Projects Division for review.
    ii. Revised procedure 100-QC-007, ``Project Execution.''
    iii. Developed procedure 100-QC-007.1, ``Nuclear Projects'' which 
defined the Nuclear Projects Division.
    iv. Revised procedure 100-QC-014 ``Internal Audits'' to require 
additional oversight of Nuclear Projects by requiring an annual audit 
by an outside, independent Lead Auditor.
    v. Planned revision of 100-QC-017 ``Control of Nonconforming 
Items.''
    vi. Revised procedure 100-QC-017.1, ``Reporting of Defects and 
Noncompliance in Accordance with 10 CFR part 21 and 10 CFR 50.55(e),'' 
Revision 6, dated October 9, 2023, which incorporates appropriate 
evaluation criteria consistent with guidance provided in Nuclear Energy 
Institute (NEI) 14-09, ``Guidelines for Implementation of 10 CFR part 
21

[[Page 48199]]

Reporting of Defects and Noncompliance.''
    2. Mistras agreed upon future actions in the following areas (see 
Section V for details):
    a. Safety Culture and Safety Conscious Work Environment.
    b. Quality Assurance Program.
    c. Audit.
    d. Quality Assurance Program Training for Employees Involved in 
Nuclear Safety-Related Activities.
    3. The NRC considers the corrective actions and commitments 
delineated above to be appropriately prompt and comprehensive to 
address the causes which resulted in the apparent violation identified 
in NRC's December 7, 2023, letter.
    4. In consideration of the commitments delineated above and 
described in Section V below, the NRC agrees not to assess a civil 
penalty and refrain from issuing a notice of violation for all matters 
discussed in the NRC's choice letter dated December 7, 2023 (EA-23-
105).
    5. The NRC and Mistras agree that the above elements will be 
incorporated into a Confirmatory Order which will also describe the 
apparent violation.
    6. The Confirmatory Order is an escalated enforcement action in 
accordance with the NRC Enforcement Policy.
    7. In the event of the sale of Mistras Services division, which 
services commercial nuclear facilities, to another entity, the terms 
and conditions set forth hereunder shall continue to apply to the new 
entity and accordingly survive any transfer of ownership.
    8. The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax, 
rescind, or withdraw any of the above conditions upon demonstration by 
Mistras or its successors of good cause.
    Based on the completed (and planned) actions described above, and 
the commitments described in Section V below, the NRC agrees to not 
pursue any further enforcement action based on the apparent violation 
identified in NRC's December 7, 2023, letter (see Section I).
    On May 15, 2024, Mistras consented to issuing this Confirmatory 
Order with the commitments, as described in Section V below. Mistras 
further agreed that this Confirmatory Order is to be effective upon 
issuance, the agreement memorialized in this Confirmatory Order settles 
the matter between the parties, and Mistras has waived its right to a 
hearing.

IV

    I find that the actions completed or planned by Mistras, as 
described in Section III above, combined with the commitments as set 
forth in Section V, are acceptable and necessary, and conclude that 
public health and safety are reasonably assured with these completed 
actions and commitments. In view of the foregoing, I have determined 
that public health and safety require that Mistras' commitments be 
confirmed by this Order. Based on the above and Mistras' consent, this 
Confirmatory Order is effective upon issuance.

V

    Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 104b, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182, and 
186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's 
regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR part 50, as applicable, it is 
hereby ordered, effective upon issuance, that:

reviewed and updated, as needed, at a frequency not to exceed 24 
months.
    5. In the event of the sale of Mistras Services division, which 
services commercial nuclear facilities, to another entity, the terms 
and conditions set forth hereunder shall continue to apply to the new 
entity and accordingly survive any transfer of ownership.
    6. The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax, 
rescind, or withdraw any of the above conditions upon demonstration by 
Mistras or its successors of good cause.

VI

    In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR 2.309, any person 
adversely affected by this CO, other than Mistras, may request a 
hearing within 30 calendar days of the date of issuance of this CO. 
Where good cause is shown, consideration will be given to extending the 
time to request a hearing. A request for extension of time must be made 
in writing to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and include a statement of 
good cause for the extension.
    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including a 
request for hearing and petition for leave to intervene (petition), any 
motion or other document filed in the proceeding prior to the 
submission of a petition, and documents filed by interested 
governmental entities that request to participate under 10 CFR 
2.315(c), must be filed in accordance with the NRC's E-Filing rule (72 
FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 FR 46562; August 3, 2012). 
The E-Filing process requires participants to submit and serve all 
adjudicatory documents over the internet, or in some cases to mail 
copies on electronic storage media. Detailed guidance on making 
electronic submissions may be found in the Guidance for Electronic 
Submissions to the NRC and on the NRC website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html. Participants may not submit paper copies 
of their filings unless they seek an exemption in accordance with the 
procedures described below.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the hearing in this 
proceeding if the Secretary has not already established an electronic 
docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. Once a participant has obtained a 
digital ID certificate and a docket has been created, the participant 
can then submit adjudicatory documents. Submissions must be in Portable 
Document Format (PDF). Additional guidance on PDF submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the due date. Upon receipt of 
a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email notice confirming receipt of the document. The 
E-Filing system also distributes an email notice that provides access 
to the document to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any 
others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to 
participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the 
document on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and 
other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for 
and receive a digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are 
filed so that they can obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing 
system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal 
government holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings

[[Page 48201]]

must be submitted by (1) first class mail addressed to the Office of 
the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications 
Staff; or (2) courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service to 
the Office of the Secretary, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 
20852, Attention: Rulemaking and Adjudications Staff. Participants 
filing adjudicatory documents in this manner are responsible for 
serving the document on all other participants. Filing is considered 
complete by first-class mail as of the time of deposit in the mail, or 
by courier, express mail, or expedited delivery service upon depositing 
the document with the provider of the service. A presiding officer, 
having granted an exemption request from using E-Filing, may require a 
participant or party to use E-Filing if the presiding officer 
subsequently determines that the reason for granting the exemption from 
use of E-Filing no longer exists.
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket which is available to the public at 
https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
Commission or the presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued 
digital ID certificate as described above, click ``cancel'' when the 
link requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to 
the NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access 
any publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information, 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings, unless an NRC regulation or other law 
requires submission of such information. For example, in some 
instances, individuals provide home addresses in order to demonstrate 
proximity to a facility or site. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants are 
requested not to include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    The Commission will issue a notice or order granting or denying a 
petition, designating the issues for any hearing that will be held, and 
designating the Presiding Officer. A notice granting a hearing will be 
published in the Federal Register and served on the parties to the 
hearing.
    If a person (other than Mistras) requests a hearing, that person 
shall set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is 
adversely affected by this CO and shall address the criteria set forth 
in 10 CFR 2.309(d) and (f). If a hearing is requested by a person whose 
interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an order 
designating the time and place of any hearings. If a hearing is held, 
the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this CO 
should be sustained.
    In the absence of any request for hearing, or written approval of 
an extension of time in which to request a hearing, the provisions 
specified in Section V above shall be final 30 days from the date of 
this CO without further order or proceedings. If an extension of time 
for requesting a hearing has been approved, the provisions specified in 
Section V shall be final when the extension expires if a hearing 
request has not been received.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

    Dated this 22 day of May 2024.

David L. Pelton,

Director, Office of Enforcement.

ACTION: Notice of availability; request for comment; issuance of 
programmatic agreement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for 
public comment a draft environmental assessment (EA) and draft finding 
of no significant impact (FONSI) for a proposed amendment of NRC 
Possession Only License (POL) No. DPR-73 for the Three Mile Island 
Nuclear Station, Unit No. 2 (TMI-2), located in Londonderry Township, 
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. The proposed amendment would ensure that 
TMI-2 Energy Solutions (TMI-2Solutions) can continue decommissioning 
the facility in accordance with NRC regulations. TMI-2Solutions will be 
engaging in certain major decommissioning activities, including the 
physical demolition of buildings previously deemed eligible for the 
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The draft EA, 
``Environmental Assessment for Specific Decommissioning Activities at 
Three Mile Island, Unit 2 in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania,'' documents 
the NRC staff's environmental review of the license amendment 
application. The

II. Background

    The Three Mile Island Nuclear Station (TMINS) is approximately 16 
kilometers (10 miles) southeast of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The TMINS 
site includes Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 1 (TMl-1) and 
TMl-2. It encompasses approximately 178 hectares (440 acres), including 
the adjacent islands on the north end, a strip of land on the mainland 
along the eastern shore of the river, and an area on the eastern shore 
of Shelley Island. The TMINS site has significance in U.S. history 
because it is the site of the nation's most serious commercial nuclear 
power plant accident, occurring at TMI-2. On March 28, 1979, TMI-2 
experienced an accident initiated by interruption of secondary 
feedwater flow which led to a core heat up that caused fuel damage. The 
partial meltdown of the reactor core led to a very small offsite 
release of radioactivity. In response to this accident many changes 
occurred at nuclear power plants including emergency response planning, 
reactor operator training, human factors engineering, radiation 
protection, and heightened NRC regulatory oversight.

III. Introduction

    By letter dated February 22, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23058A064), TMI-2Solutions requested an amendment to POL No. DPR-73. 
TMI-2Solutions will be engaging in certain major decommissioning 
activities, including the physical demolition of buildings previously 
deemed eligible for the NRHP. Because the impacts on the historic 
properties from these decommissioning activities have not been 
previously evaluated and are not bounded by the impact's discussion in 
NUREG-0586, ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement on 
Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities,'' TMI-2Solutions requested an 
amendment that would require evaluation of the impacts of the 
decommissioning activities on the NRHP-eligible properties, in 
compliance with paragraph 50.82(a)(6)(ii) of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR).
    Pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8, the NRC is using its National 
Environmental Policy Act process for developing the environmental 
assessment (EA) to facilitate consultation pursuant to section 106 of 
the NHPA.
    Adverse effects to historic properties would result from 
decommissioning activities at TMI-2. Therefore, the NRC and consulting 
parties proceeded with development of a PA to resolve adverse effects. 
On March 6, 2024 (89 FR 16037)

[[Page 47996]]

the draft PA was issued for public review and comment. One comment was 
received and considered before finalizing the PA. The final PA (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML24117A258) addresses the potential direct and indirect 
adverse effects from the decommissioning activities and ensures that 
appropriate mitigation measures are implemented. The NRC is issuing the 
final PA, which therefore, concludes NHPA Section 106 consultation.
    In accordance with NRC's regulations in 10 CFR part 51, 
``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions,'' that implement the National Environment 
Protection Agency (NEPA), the NRC staff has prepared a draft EA 
documenting its environmental review of the license amendment 
application. Based on the environmental review, the NRC has made a 
preliminary determination that the proposed action will not 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment and that a 
FONSI is therefore appropriate. By this notice, the NRC is requesting 
public comment on the draft FONSI and supporting draft EA.

IV. Summary of Draft Environmental Assessment

    The draft EA is publicly available in ADAMS under Accession No. 
ML24117A224. A summary description of the proposed action and expected 
environmental impacts is provided as follows.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action is to amend POL No. DPR-73 so that TMI-
2Solutions can continue with certain major decommissioning activities 
planned under Phase 2 of its decommissioning schedule. Phase 2 
decommissioning activities include the removal of any radioactive 
components in preparation for demolition of structures, decommissioning 
and dismantlement of the TMI-2 site to a level that permits the release 
of the site, except for an area potentially to be set aside for storage 
of fuel-bearing material (small quantities of spent nuclear fuel, 
damaged core material, and high-level waste) on the independent spent 
fuel storage installation, backfilling of the site, license termination 
plan submittal and implementation, and site restoration activities. In 
order to comply with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(6)(ii), TMI-2Solutions requested 
that NRC evaluate the impacts of certain major decommissioning 
activities on historic and cultural resources and NRHP-eligible 
properties. The definition of major decommissioning activity is in 10 
CFR 50.2, which states ``Major decommissioning activity means, for a 
nuclear power reactor facility, any activity that results in permanent 
removal of major radioactive components, permanently modifies the 
structure of the containment, or results in dismantling components for 
shipment containing greater than class C waste in accordance with Sec.  
61.55 of this chapter.'' Due to radioactive contamination, the TMI-2 
structures must be demolished and removed during decommissioning.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    In the draft EA, the staff assessed the potential environmental 
impacts from the proposed license amendment to the following resource 
areas: land use; visual and scenic resources; the geologic environment; 
surface and groundwater resources; ecological resources; air quality; 
noise; historic and cultural resources; socioeconomic conditions; 
environmental justice; public and occupational health; transportation; 
and waste generation and management. The NRC staff also considered the 
cumulative impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
actions when combined with the proposed action. The TMI-2 Historic 
District would be adversely affected by the TMI-2 decommissioning, and 
adverse effects cannot be avoided. The mitigation of adverse effects to 
the TMI-2 Historic District will be completed in accordance with the 
TMI-2 Demolition and Decommissioning Programmatic Agreement (NRC 
2024a).
    As part of the NRC's consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered 
Species Act, the NRC staff determined that the proposed action may 
affect, but is not likely to adversely affect, the Indiana bat (Myotis 
sodalis), northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis), tricolored 
bat (Perimyotis subflavus), monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), 
northeastern bulrush (Scirpus ancistrochaetus), or green floater 
(Lasmigona subviridis). The NRC staff transmitted an email to the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service for its review and concurrence on May 24, 
2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24120A324).
    All other potential impacts from the proposed action were 
determined to not be significant, as described in the draft EA. The NRC 
staff found that there would be no significant negative cumulative 
impact to any resource area from the proposed action when added to 
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternative to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC staff considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Under the no-action alternative, the NRC would deny the licensee's 
request for an amendment to allow for the continuation of major 
decommissioning activities under Phase 2. In this case, the NRC staff 
would not review the historic and cultural resource impacts of the 
major decommissioning activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.2 and would 
therefore disallow the removal of NRHP-eligible structures and any 
impacts to historic and cultural resources. However, due to the 
presence of radioactive contamination, TMI-2 structures, including the 
NRHP-eligible structures, must be removed during the decommissioning 
process. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that denying the amendment 
request is not a reasonable alternative.

V. Draft Finding of No Significant Impact

    In accordance with the NEPA and 10 CFR part 51, the NRC staff has 
conducted an environmental review of a request for an amendment to POL 
No. DPR-73. The proposed amendment would revise POL No. DPR-73 to allow 
the licensee to conduct decommissioning at TMI-2 covering activities 
that were not previously addressed in the staff's environmental 
assessments (site-specific historical and cultural resources). Based on 
its environmental review of the proposed action, as documented in the 
draft EA, the NRC staff has preliminarily determined that granting the 
requested license amendment would not significantly affect the quality 
of the human environment. Therefore, the NRC staff has preliminarily 
determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, that preparation of an 
environmental impact statement is not required for the proposed action 
and a FONSI is appropriate. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.33(a), the NRC staff 
is making the draft FONSI and draft EA available for public review and 
comment.

    Dated: May 29, 2024.

Chief, Environmental Project Management Branch 2, Division of 
Rulemaking, Environmental, and Financial Support, Office of Nuclear 
Material Safety, and Safeguards.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-613; NRC-2024-0078]


US SFR Owner, LLC.; Kemmerer Power Station, Unit 1; Construction 
Permit Application

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Acceptance for docketing, opportunity to request a hearing and 
petition for leave to intervene; order imposing procedures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has accepted for 
review and docketed an application from US SFR Owner, LLC (USO) for a 
construction permit for the Kemmerer Power Station, Unit 1 reactor to 
be built in Lincoln County, Wyoming. In addition, the NRC is providing 
notice that an uncontested hearing will be held on the USO construction 
permit application at a time and place to be set in the future by the 
presiding officer for the uncontested hearing. This notice also 
provides the public an opportunity to request a hearing and petition 
for leave to intervene (i.e., contested hearing) with respect to that 
application. The NRC staff is currently conducting a detailed technical 
review of the construction permit application. If the NRC issues a 
construction permit, the applicant, USO, would be authorized to 
construct its proposed reactor in accordance with the provisions of the 
construction permit. Because the application contains Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI), this notice includes 
an order that imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for 
contention preparation.

DATES: The application was docketed on May 21, 2024. A request for a 
hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed by August 5, 
2024. Any potential party as defined in section 2.4 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) who believes access to SUNSI is 
necessary to respond to this notice must request document access by 
June 14, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    By letter dated March 28, 2024 (ADAMS Package Accession No. 
ML24088A059), TerraPower, LLC (TerraPower), on behalf of US SFR Owner, 
LLC (USO), a wholly owned subsidiary of TerraPower, submitted, pursuant 
to 10 CFR part 50, ``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization 
Facilities,'' a construction permit application that proposes to 
construct a non-light water reactor (a ``non-light water reactor'' as 
defined in 10 CFR 50.2). A notice of receipt and availability of USO's 
application was published in the Federal Register on May 14, 2024 (89 
FR 42004). Along with other documents, the ADAMS package includes the 
transmittal letter (ADAMS Accession No. ML24088A060), the preliminary 
safety analysis report (ADAMS Accession No. ML24088A065), and the 
environmental report (ADAMS Accession No. ML24088A072). The application 
was supplemented on May 2, 2024 (ADAMS Accession Nos. ML24123A242 and 
ML24123A243) and May 9, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24130A181).
    The NRC is considering issuance of a construction permit to USO 
that would authorize construction of the proposed reactor, identified 
as Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1, to be located in Lincoln County, 
Wyoming. The reactor would be a metal fueled, pool-type Sodium Fast 
Reactor (SFR).
    The USO construction permit application consists of the following 
information:
     The general information required by 10 CFR 50.33;
     The Preliminary Safety Analysis Report required by 10 CFR 
50.34(a);
     The Environmental Report required by 10 CFR 51.50; and
     Exemption requests to support issuance of a construction 
permit.
    The NRC staff determined that the USO application is complete and 
acceptable for docketing in accordance with 10 CFR 2.101(a) and 10 CFR 
part 50 and assigned the Docket Number 50-613. The NRC staff provided 
USO notice of the acceptance and docketing determination by letter 
dated May 21, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24135A109).
    The NRC staff will perform a detailed technical review of the 
construction permit application and document its safety findings in a 
safety evaluation report. Also, in accordance with 10 CFR part 51, 
``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions,'' the NRC staff will complete an 
environmental review for the proposed action.
    Docketing of the application does not preclude the NRC staff from 
requesting additional information from the applicant as the review 
proceeds, nor does it predict whether the Commission will grant or deny 
the application. The construction permit application will be referred 
to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards for review and report 
consistent with 10 CFR 50.58, ``Hearings and report of the Advisory 
Committee on Reactor Safeguards.'' If the Commission finds that the 
construction permit application meets the applicable standards of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended and the Commission's regulations, 
and that any required notifications to other agencies and bodies have 
been made, the Commission will issue a construction

[[Page 47998]]

permit, in the form and containing conditions and limitations that the 
Commission finds appropriate and necessary.

II. Hearing

    Pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 10 CFR part 
2, ``Agency Rules of Practice and Procedure,'' and 10 CFR part 50, 
notice is hereby given that an uncontested (i.e., mandatory) hearing 
will be held, at a time and place to be set in the future by the 
presiding officer for the uncontested hearing.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the 60-day deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/esubmittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to: (1) request a digital identification 
(ID) certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-refmat.html. A filing is considered complete at the time 
the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system timestamps the document and sends the 
submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/esubmittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, excluding government holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as described above, click ``cancel'' when the link requests 
certificates and you will be automatically directed to the NRC's 
electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such

[[Page 47999]]

information. With respect to copyrighted works, except for limited 
excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory filings and would 
constitute a Fair Use application, participants should not include 
copyrighted materials in their submission.

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information for Contention Preparation

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI).
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of hearing and 
opportunity to petition for leave to intervene, any potential party who 
believes access to SUNSI is necessary to respond to this notice may 
request access to SUNSI. A ``potential party'' is any person who 
intends to participate as a party by demonstrating standing and filing 
an admissible contention under 10 CFR 2.309. Requests for access to 
SUNSI submitted later than 10 days after publication of this notice 
will not be considered absent a showing of good cause for the late 
filing, addressing why the request could not have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemakings and 
Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy General Counsel 
for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the General 
Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001. 
The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both offices is: 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, 
Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the Secretary and 
the Office of the General Counsel are [email protected] and 
[email protected] \1\ respectively. The request must 
include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI under these 
procedures should be submitted as described in this paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice;
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1); and
    (3) The identity of the individual or entity requesting access to 
SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the need for the information in 
order to meaningfully participate in this adjudicatory proceeding. In 
particular, the request must explain why publicly available versions of 
the information requested would not be sufficient to provide the basis 
and specificity for a proffered contention.
    D. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraph C, the NRC staff will determine within 10 days of receipt of 
the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI.
    E. If the NRC staff determines that the requestor satisfies both 
D.(1) and D.(2), the NRC staff will notify the requestor in writing 
that access to SUNSI has been granted. The written notification will 
contain instructions on how the requestor may obtain copies of the 
requested documents, and any other conditions that may apply to access 
to those documents. These conditions may include, but are not limited 
to, the signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or 
Protective Order \2\ setting forth terms and conditions to prevent the 
unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of SUNSI by each individual who 
will be granted access to SUNSI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    F. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 days after 
receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more than 25 
days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) the 
information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing), the 
petitioner may file its SUNSI contentions by that later deadline.
    G. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI is denied by the NRC staff 
after a determination on standing and requisite need, the NRC staff 
shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly stating the 
reason or reasons for the denial.
    (2) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination by filing a challenge within 5 days of receipt of that 
determination with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    (3) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    H. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest independent of the proceeding. 
Such a challenge must be filed within 5 days of the notification by the 
NRC staff of its grant of access and must be filed with: (a) the 
presiding officer designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if he or 
she is unavailable, another administrative judge, or an Administrative 
Law Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a) if another 
officer has been designated to rule on information access issues, with 
that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or denying access) is governed by 10 
CFR 2.311.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562; August 3, 2012) apply to appeals of NRC staff 
determinations (because they must be served on a presiding officer 
or the Commission, as applicable), but not to the initial SUNSI 
request submitted to the NRC staff under these procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests

                            identified by name and address; describing
                            the need for the information in order for

                            provides a reasonable basis to believe
                            standing can be established and shows need

Owner, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of TerraPower, filed an 
application for a construction permit for a single-unit power reactor 
facility located in Lincoln County, Wyoming, pursuant to section 103 of 
the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, and part 50 of title 10 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities.'' The single-unit facility is to be identified 
as Kemmerer Power Station, Unit 1 and would be based on the TerraPower 
and General Electric-Hitachi Natrium reactor design which is a pool-
type sodium fast reactor using metal fuel.
    The application submitted on March 28, 2024, is available in ADAMS 
under Package Accession No. ML24088A059. Along with other documents, 
the ADAMS package includes the transmittal letter (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24088A060), the preliminary safety analysis report (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24088A065), and the environmental report (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24088A072). The application was supplemented on May 2, 2024 (ADAMS

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Licenses and Radiation Safety Requirements for Irradiators.'' The NRC 
hereby informs potential respondents that an agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and that a person is not required to respond to, a collection 
of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on January 11, 2024, 89 FR 1946.
    1. The title of the information collection: Licenses and Radiation 
Safety Requirements for Irradiators.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0158.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Applications 
for new licenses and license amendments may be submitted at any time 
(on occasion). Applications for renewal are submitted every 15 years. 
Reports are submitted as events occur.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Applicants for and 
holders of specific licenses authorizing the use of licensed material 
for irradiators.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 1,527.2 (19.2 for 
reporting [2.2 NRC licensees and 17 Agreement State licensees], 52 for 
recordkeepers [6 NRC licensees and 46 Agreement State Licensees], and 
1,456 for third-party disclosures [168 NRC licensees and 1,288 
Agreement State licensees]).
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 52 (6 NRC licensees 
and 46 Agreement State licensees).
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 29,781 hours (687 
reporting hours + 21,762 recordkeeping hours + 7,332 third-party 
disclosure hours).
    10. Abstract: Part 36 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations, establishes radiation safety requirements for the use of 
radioactive material for irradiators. The information in the 
applications, reports, and records is used by the NRC staff to ensure 
that the health and safety of the public is protected and that the 
licensee possession and use of source or byproduct material is in 
compliance with license and regulatory requirements.

Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering 
issuance of an exemption in response to the April 24, 2023, request 
from Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO), for the Haddam 
Neck Plant (HNP or Haddam Neck) located in East Hampton, Connecticut. 
The proposed exemption from NRC regulations, if granted, would permit 
CYAPCO to make withdrawals from a segregated account within Haddam 
Neck's overall nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT), on an annual basis, 
for spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and Greater than Class C (GTCC) waste 
management and non-radiological site restoration without prior 
notification to the NRC. The NRC staff is issuing an environmental 
assessment (EA) and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) associated 
with the proposed exemption.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Introduction

    By letter dated April 24, 2023, CYAPCO submitted a request to the 
NRC for an exemption from paragraphs 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(2) of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) for 
the Haddam Neck Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation \1\ 
(ISFSI).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As discussed in this document, the Haddam Neck ISFSI sits on 
the former site of HNP, which CYAPCO finished decommissioning in 
2007. Although only the Haddam Neck ISFSI remains on the site, 
CYAPCO's 10 CFR part 50 license, Facility Operating License No. DPR-
61 remains in effect. Because CYAPCO requested an exemption from the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 50, this would be an exemption for 
CYAPCO's 10 CFR part 50 license rather than for CYAPCO's 10 CFR part 
72 general license. Therefore, although CYAPCO's submission 
requested an exemption for the Haddam Neck ISFSI, the NRC staff will 
consider it a request for an exemption for HNP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CYAPCO has established a separate (segregated) account within its 
over-arching NDT, entitled ``ISFSI Radiological Decom,'' that 
identifies the funds for radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI 
apart from the larger balance of funds in the NDT allocated for ongoing 
management of SNF and GTCC waste and for non-radiological site 
restoration activities. Although 10 CFR 50.82 applies to the segregated 
account, it does not apply to the overall NDT.
    If granted, the exemptions from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 
50.75(h)(2) would permit CYAPCO to make withdrawals from the segregated 
account, on an annual basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-
radiological site restoration without prior notification to the NRC. 
More specifically, with this exemption, CYAPCO would be able to 
annually transfer funds exceeding 110 percent of the inflation-adjusted 
decommissioning cost estimate (DCE), described in 10 CFR 50.75, from 
the segregated account to its overarching NDT and use those funds for 
SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration.
    HNP began commercial operations in January 1968, and ceased power 
production in December 1996. CYAPCO initiated decommissioning shortly 
thereafter. In July 2007, HNP completed its final decommissioning of 
the reactor site, except for the ISFSI, which included dismantling and 
removing all reactor plant related facilities. As a result, only the 
ISFSI remains at the old plant site of HNP in East Hampton, 
Connecticut.
    By letter dated November 26, 2007, NRC approved the release of most 
portions of the HNP site from the 10 CFR part 50 license (DPR-61) for 
unrestricted release, except for the ISFSI and immediately surrounding 
areas. Under its 10 CFR part 72 general license, HNP is authorized to 
possess, and store SNF at the permanently shut down and decommissioned 
facility under the provision of 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.''
    The NRC staff is performing both a safety evaluation and an 
environmental review to determine whether to grant this exemption 
request. The NRC staff will prepare a separate safety evaluation report 
(SER) to document its safety review and analysis. The NRC's SER will 
evaluate the proposed exemption for reasonable assurance of adequate 
protection of public health and safety, and the common defense and 
security. This EA documents the environmental review which the NRC 
staff prepared in accordance with 10 CFR 51.21 and 51.30(a). The NRC's 
decision whether to grant the exemption will be based on the results of 
the NRC staff's review as documented in this EA, and the staff's safety 
review to be documented in the SER.

II. Environmental Assessment

    By letter dated April 24, 2023, CYAPCO submitted a request to the 
NRC for an exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(2). If granted, the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) would permit CYAPCO to make 
withdrawals from the segregated account, on an annual basis, for SNF 
and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration without 
prior notification to the NRC. More specifically, with this exemption, 
CYAPCO would be able to annually transfer funds exceeding 110 percent 
of the inflation-adjusted DCE, described in 10 CFR 50.75, from the 
segregated account to its overarching NDT and use those funds for SNF 
and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration 
activities.

Need for the Proposed Action

    As required by 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A), decommissioning trust 
funds may be used by the licensee if the withdrawals are for legitimate 
decommissioning activity expenses, consistent with the definition of 
decommissioning in 10 CFR 50.2. This definition addresses radiological 
decommissioning and does not include activities associated with 
management of SNF and GTCC waste or non-radiological site restoration. 
Similarly, the requirements of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) restrict the use of 
decommissioning trust fund disbursements (other than for ordinary and 
incidental expenses) to decommissioning expenses until final 
decommissioning has been completed.
    CYAPCO stated that it has established a segregated account, 
entitled ``ISFSI Radiological Decom,'' within its over-arching NDT, 
that identifies the funds for radiological decommissioning of the 
ISFSI. This segregated account is apart from the larger balance of 
funds in the NDT allocated for ongoing management of SNF and GTCC waste 
and for other non-radiological site restoration activities. Therefore, 
exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) is needed to 
allow CYAPCO to use funds from the segregated account for SNF and GTCC 
waste management and other non-radiological site restoration 
activities.
    In its Decommissioning Funding Assurance Status Report dated March 
6, 2023, CYAPCO stated that, its inflation-adjusted DCE for the 
radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI is approximately $7.1 million 
in 2022 dollars. It asserted this amount provides reasonable assurance 
of adequate funding to complete the NRC required decommissioning 
activities. In the same report, CYAPCO reported that the segregated 
``ISFSI Radiological Decom'' account had $46.4 million in 2022 dollars 
as of December 31, 2022. More specifically, in its exemption request, 
CYAPCO provided a table showing $7,070,450, in 2022 dollars, as the 
inflation-adjusted DCE. CYAPCO's exemption request further stated that 
the segregated account has a balance of $47,609,309 as of December 31, 
2022, meaning that the segregated account had a balance of $40,538,859, 
or 573 percent beyond the inflation-adjusted DCE.
    CYAPCO stated that, if the exemption is granted, funds in its 
segregated account which exceed 110 percent of the inflation-adjusted 
DCE for the radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI would be 
transferred to the overarching NDT on an annual basis without prior NRC 
notification. CYAPCO would then use those funds for SNF and GTCC waste 
management and non-radiological site restoration, which in turn, would 
allow CYAPCO to return its additional excess funds in the overarching 
NDT to its customers as part of future rate cases with the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission.

[[Page 46172]]

    The requirements of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) further provide that, except 
for withdrawals being made under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) or for payments of 
ordinary administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the NDT 
in connection with the operation of the NDT, no disbursement may be 
made from the NDT without written notice to the NRC at least 30 working 
days in advance. Therefore, an exemption from 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) is 
also needed to allow CYAPCO to use funds from the segregated account 
for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration 
activities without prior NRC notification.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action involves an exemption from requirements that 
are of financial and/or administrative nature and that do not have an 
impact on the environment. Before the NRC could approve the proposed 
action, it would have to conclude that there is reasonable assurance 
that adequate funds are available in the segregated account to complete 
all activities associated with radiological decommissioning as well as 
SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration. 
Therefore, there would be no decrease in safety associated with the use 
of funds from the segregated account to also fund activities associated 
with SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site-
restoration.
    The requested exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2), if approved, would allow 
transfers on an annual basis. CYAPCO stated that it will continue to 
provide its annual decommissioning funding assurance status report in 
accordance with 10 CFR 50.75(f)(1) and (2) and 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(v) 
and (vi) requirements. These reports provide the NRC staff with 
awareness of, and the ability to act on, any actual or potential 
funding deficiencies. As the proposed exemption would not affect these 
requirements, the NRC staff would have tools available for any 
potential funding deficiencies. Since the exemption would allow CYAPCO 
to use funds from the segregated account that are in excess of those 
required for radiological decommissioning, the adequacy of funds 
dedicated for radiological decommissioning would not be affected by the 
proposed exemption. Therefore, there is reasonable assurance that there 
would be no environmental impact due to lack of adequate funding for 
radiological decommissioning.
    Further, there are no new accident precursors created by using the 
excess funds from the segregated account for SNF and GTCC waste 
management and non-radiological site-restoration. The exemption, if 
granted, would be financial and/or administrative in nature. Thus, the 
probability of postulated accidents is not increased. Also, the 
consequences of postulated accidents are not increased. No changes are 
being made in the types or amounts of effluents that may be released 
offsite. There is no significant increase in occupational or public 
radiation exposure. Therefore, the requested exemption will not present 
an undue risk to the public health and safety.
    With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed 
action would have no direct impacts on land use or water resources, 
including terrestrial and aquatic biota, as it involves no new 
construction or modification of plant operational systems. There would 
be no changes to the quality or quantity of non-radiological effluents. 
In addition, there would be no noticeable effect on socioeconomic 
conditions in the region, no environmental justice impacts, no air 
quality impacts, and no impacts to historic and cultural resources from 
the proposed action. Therefore, there are no significant non-
radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
    For these reasons, the NRC concludes there are no significant 
environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption request.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    In addition to the proposed action, the NRC staff also considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Denial of the exemption request would result in no change in current 
environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action 
and the alternative action would be similar.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies Consulted

    By email dated April 5, 2024, the NRC provided a copy of the draft 
EA to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental 
Protection, Radiation Division, for review. By email dated May 6, 2024, 
Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, 
Radiation Division, indicated that it had no comments.

Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation

    Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), 
requires Federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service or National Marine Fisheries Service regarding actions that may 
affect listed species or designated critical habitats. The ESA is 
intended to prevent further decline of endangered and threatened 
species and restore those species and their critical habitat.
    The NRC staff determined that a consultation under section 7 of the 
ESA is not required because the proposed action will not affect listed 
species or critical habitat.

National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Consultation

    Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) 
requires Federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings 
on historic properties. As stated in the NHPA, historic properties are 
any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or 
object included in, or eligible for inclusion in the National Register 
of Historic Places.
    The NRC determined that the scope of activities described in this 
exemption request do not have the potential to cause effects on 
historic properties because the NRC's approval of this exemption 
request will not authorize new construction or land disturbance 
activities. The NRC staff also determined that the proposed action is 
not a type of activity that has the potential to impact historic 
properties because the proposed action would occur within the 
established HNP site boundary. Therefore, in accordance with 36 CFR 
800.3(a)(1), no consultation is required under section 106 of NHPA.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action--an exemption from 
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) 
allowing CYAPCO to make withdrawals from the segregated account, on an 
annual basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological 
site restoration without prior notification to the NRC--have been 
reviewed under the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
    The proposed exemption would not have a significant adverse effect 
on the probability of an accident occurring and would not have any 
significant radiological or non-radiological impacts. The proposed 
exemption involves an

[[Page 46173]]

exemption from requirements that are of a financial and/or 
administrative nature and would not have an impact on the human 
environment. Consistent with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC conducted the EA for 
the proposed exemption, and this FONSI incorporates by reference the EA 
included in this document. Therefore, the NRC concludes that the 
proposed action will not have significant effects on the quality of the 
human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined not to prepare 
an environmental impact statement for the proposed action.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Docket No. 50-423

Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut, Inc., Millstone Power Station, 
Unit No. 3; Exemption

I. Background

    Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut, Inc. (DENC, the licensee) is 
the holder of Renewed Facility Operating License No. NPF-49, which 
authorizes operation of Millstone Power

[[Page 46168]]

Station, Unit No. 3 (Millstone 3), a pressurized-water reactor (PWR). 
The license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject 
to all rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC) now or hereafter in effect.
    Millstone 3 shares the site with Millstone Power Station, Unit 1, a 
permanently defueled boiling water reactor nuclear unit, and Millstone 
Power Station, Unit 2, a PWR. The facility is located in Waterford, 
Connecticut, approximately 3.2 miles west southwest of New London, 
Connecticut. This exemption applies to Millstone 3 only. The other 
units, Units 1 and 2, are not covered by this exemption.

II. Request/Action

    By letter dated May 2, 2023 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML23123A279), as supplemented 
by letter dated April 1, 2024 (ML24093A216), DENC, requested an 
exemption to title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), part 
50, section 50.46, ``Acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling 
systems for light-water nuclear power reactors,'' and part 50, Appendix 
K, ``ECCS [Emergency Core Cooling Systems] Evaluation Models,'' for 
Millstone 3.
    This exemption request relates solely to the specific types of 
cladding materials for which 10 CFR 50.46 and 10 CFR part 50, Appendix 
K, are expressly applicable, namely zircaloy and ZIRLOTM. 
Since these regulations specifically apply only to zircaloy and 
ZIRLOTM, an exemption would be required to apply them to 
fuel clad with other materials, in this case Framatome M5\TM\. 
Therefore, the licensee has requested such an exemption to support the 
introduction of Framatome GAIA fuel with the M5\TM\ cladding. The 
proposed request would not exempt Millstone 3 from other requirements 
of 10 CFR 50.46 or 10 CFR part 50, appendix K, such as acceptance 
criteria, evaluation model features and documentation, and reporting of 
changes or errors.
    This exemption request is specific to the M5\TM\ cladding material 
exemption request only. The technical analysis necessary to support the 
use of M5\TM\ cladding in the Millstone 3 GAIA Small Break and Large 
Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident (SBLOCA and RLBLOCA) evaluations under 
Framatome methods is documented in a separate safety evaluation for the 
related license amendment request (ML24109A003).

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the licensee requested an exemption from 
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.46, and appendix K to 10 CFR part 50. The 
proposed exemption request would permit application of the requirements 
of 10 CFR 50.46 and appendix K to 10 CFR part 50 to fuel assemblies 
containing fuel rods fabricated with M5\TM\ cladding material at 
Millstone 3.
    The technical basis for the use of fuel clad with M5\TM\ in PWRs is 
documented in Topical Report (TR) BAW-10227P-A, Revision 1, 
``Evaluation of Advanced Cladding and Structural Material (M5) in PWR 
Reactor Fuel,'' dated June 2003 (ADAMS Package No. ML15162B043).
    This TR describes Framatome's evaluation for the use of the M5\TM\ 
alloy in PWR fuel assemblies as a replacement for Zircaloy-4. This TR 
discusses material properties of M5\TM\, as well as its behavior under 
normal operation, anticipated transients, and postulated accident 
conditions.
    The regulation in 10 CFR 50.46(a)(1)(i) requires, in part, that 
each boiling or pressurized light-water nuclear power reactor fueled 
with uranium oxide pellets within cylindrical zircaloy or ZIRLO\TM\ 
cladding must be provided with an ECCS that must be designed so that 
its calculated cooling performance following postulated loss-of-coolant 
accidents conforms to the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 50.46(b). Since 
10 CFR 50.46 specifically refers to fuel with zircaloy or 
ZIRLOTM cladding, the use of fuel with M5TM 
cladding requires an exemption from this section of the regulations.
    Paragraph I.A.5, ``Metal--Water Reaction Rate,'' of appendix K to 
10 CFR part 50 requires the Baker-Just equation be used in the ECCS 
evaluation model to determine the rate of energy release, hydrogen 
generation, and cladding oxidation. The requirement for using the 
Baker-Just equation in appendix K conformant loss-of-coolant accident 
(LOCA) evaluation models presume use of zircaloy- or 
ZIRLOTM-clad fuel rods. Therefore, application of 10 CFR 
part 50, appendix K to cladding materials other than zircaloy or 
ZIRLOTM also requires an exemption. Pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12, the NRC may, upon application by any interested person or upon 
its own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR 
part 50 when: (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not 
present an undue risk to the public health or safety, and are 
consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) when special 
circumstances are present. Under 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special 
circumstances include, among other things, when application of the 
specific regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve, or 
is not necessary to achieve, the underlying purpose of the rule.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    In accordance with 10 CFR 50.12, the NRC may grant an exemption 
from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 if the exemption is authorized 
by law. The exemption requested in this instance is authorized by law, 
because no other prohibition of law exists to preclude the activities 
which would be authorized by the exemption.
    This exemption would allow the use of M5\TM\ cladding at Millstone 
3 for GAIA SBLOCA and RLBLOCA analyses performed using Framatome (FRM) 
methods, instead of zircaloy or ZIRLO\TM\ cladding. Selection of a 
specific cladding material in 10 CFR 50, appendix K was at the 
discretion of the Commission consistent with its statutory authority. 
No statute required the NRC to adopt this specification. As stated 
above, 10 CFR 50.12 allows the Commission to grant exemptions from the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 50. The NRC staff has determined that 
granting of an exemption from 10 CFR part 50, appendix K related to 
M5\TM\ cladding, which is neither Zircaloy nor ZIRLO, will not result 
in a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the 
Commission's regulations. Therefore, the exemption is authorized by 
law.

B. The Exemption Presents No Undue Risk to Public Health and Safety

    The 10 CFR 50.46 requirements establish acceptance criteria for 
ECCS performance for reactors fueled with zircaloy or ZIRLO cladding 
during a LOCA. The technical basis for the use of fuel clad with M5\TM\ 
in PWRs is documented in NRC-approved TR BAW-10227P-A, Revision 1, 
``Evaluation of Advanced Cladding and Structural Material (M5) in PWR 
Reactor Fuel,'' dated June 2003 (ADAMS Package No. ML15162B043). In 
this TR, Framatome demonstrated that the effectiveness of the ECCS will 
not be affected by a change from zircaloy or ZIRLO fuel rod cladding to 
M5\TM\ fuel rod cladding. The analysis described in the TR demonstrated 
that the ECCS acceptance criteria applied to reactors fueled with 
zircaloy or ZIRLO clad fuel are also applicable to reactors fueled with 
M5\TM\ fuel rod cladding.
    Paragraph I.A.5 of appendix K to 10 CFR 50 requires that the Baker-
Just equation be used in the ECCS evaluation

[[Page 46169]]

models to determine the rate of energy release, cladding oxidation, and 
hydrogen generation. In the NRC-approved TR BAW-10227-P-A, Revision 1, 
Framatome demonstrated that the Baker-Just model is conservative in the 
postulated LOCA scenarios with respect to the use of the M5\TM\ alloy 
as a fuel rod cladding material. The Baker-Just equation is used to 
calculate cladding oxidation for the SBLOCA methodologies in the NRC-
approved TR EMF-2328-P-A, Revision 0 (ML011410383) for fuel with M5\TM\ 
cladding. The SBLOCA analysis (Attachments 3 and 4 in the licensee's 
May 2, 2023, letter) using the methodologies in TR EMF-2328-P-A, 
Revision 0 for Millstone 3 demonstrated that the amount of hydrogen 
generated in an M5-clad core meets the 10 CFR 50.46 criteria.
    The NRC staff has reviewed the SBLOCA and RLBLOCA analyses in 
Attachments 3 through 6 in the licensee's May 2, 2023, letter, and 
concluded in a safety evaluation (ML24109A003) that the LOCA analyses 
meet the applicable acceptance criteria, confirming that the use of 
M5\TM\ fuel cladding at Millstone 3 would not result in an increase in 
the consequences of postulated LOCAs beyond the required limits. Based 
on these reviews, the NRC staff concludes that the exemption presents 
no undue risk to public health and safety.

C. The Exemption Is Consistent With the Common Defense and Security

    The proposed exemption will allow the licensee to use M5\TM\ fuel 
rod cladding material, an improved fuel rod cladding material relative 
to the zircaloy material for which the requirements of 10 CFR 50.46 and 
10 CFR part 50, appendix K were originally established. In its letter 
dated May 2, 2023, the licensee stated that the M5\TM\ fuel rod 
cladding material is similar in design to the current cladding material 
used in Millstone 3. The change in cladding material will not result in 
any changes to the security aspects associated with control of special 
nuclear material and is unrelated to other security issues. In addition 
to its review of the exemption request, the NRC staff's technical 
analysis necessary to support the use of M5\TM\ cladding in the 
Millstone 3 GAIA SBLOCA and RLBLOCA evaluations under Framatome methods 
is documented in a separate safety evaluation for the related license 
amendment request (ML24109A003). Based on these reviews, the NRC staff 
concludes that the use of M5\TM\ fuel rod cladding at Millstone 3 will 
not significantly affect plant operations and is therefore consistent 
with the common defense and security.

D. Special Circumstances

    Special circumstances, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), 
are present whenever application of the regulation in the circumstances 
would not serve the purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve 
the purpose of the rule.
    The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.46 and appendix K to 10 CFR 
part 50 is to establish acceptance criteria for ECCS performance to 
provide reasonable assurance of safety in the event of a LOCA. Although 
the regulations in 10 CFR 50.46 and appendix K to 10 CFR part 50 are 
not expressly applicable to M5\TM\ fuel rod cladding, the evaluations 
described in the above section show that the purpose of the regulations 
are met by this exemption; specifically, the NRC-approved topical 
report (TR) BAW-10227-A, Revision 1 demonstrated that the effectiveness 
of the ECCS will not be affected by a change from zircaloy or ZIRLO 
fuel rod cladding to M5\TM\ fuel rod cladding and that that the ECCS 
acceptance criteria applied to reactors fueled with zircaloy or ZIRLO 
clad fuel are also applicable to reactors fueled with M5\TM\ fuel rod 
cladding.
    Paragraph I.A.5 of appendix K to 10 CFR 50 requires that the Baker-
Just equation be used in the ECCS EMs to determine the rate of energy 
release, cladding oxidation, and hydrogen generation. The NRC-approved 
TR BAW-10227-P-A, Revision 1 demonstrated that the Baker-Just model is 
conservative in the postulated LOCA scenarios with respect to the use 
of the M5\TM\ alloy as a fuel rod cladding material.
    Neither 10 CFR 50.46 acceptance criteria nor the 10 CFR 50 appendix 
K requirements for use of the Baker-Just equation in the ECCS EMs 
allows the use of M5\TM\ fuel rod cladding material, even though the 
analysis demonstrated that applying the zircaloy or ZIRLO criteria to 
M5\TM\ fuel produces acceptable results. Application of the regulatory 
requirements of 10 CFR 50.46 and 10 CFR 50 appendix K in this 
circumstance is not necessary to achieve the purpose of the rule. The 
purpose of these regulations is achieved through the application of the 
requirements to the use M5\TM\ fuel rod cladding material. Therefore, 
the NRC staff determines that special circumstances for granting of an 
exemption, defined in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), exist.

E. Environmental Considerations

    With respect to its impact on the quality of the human environment, 
the NRC has determined that the issuance of the exemption discussed 
herein meets the eligibility criteria for categorical exclusion set 
forth in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9) because it is related to a requirement 
concerning the installation or use of a facility component located 
within the restricted area, as defined in 10 CFR part 20, and issuance 
of this exemption involves: (i) no significant hazards consideration; 
(ii) no significant change in the types or a significant increase in 
the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite; and (iii) no 
significant increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation 
exposure. Therefore, in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22(b), no 
environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared in connection with the NRC's consideration of this exemption 
request. The basis for the NRC staff's determination is discussed as 
follows with an evaluation against each of the requirements in 10 CFR 
51.22(c)(9)(i)-(iii).
Requirements in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(i)
    The NRC evaluated whether the exemption involves no significant 
hazards consideration using the standards described in 10 CFR 50.92(c), 
as presented below:
    1. Does the proposed exemption involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed exemption would allow the use of M5\TM\ cladding at 
Millstone 3 for GAIA SBLOCA and RLBLOCA analyses performed using FRM 
methods. The NRC approved topical reports cited above demonstrate that 
M5\TM\ cladding has similar properties as the currently licensed 
Zircaloy. The fuel cladding itself is not a postulated initiator of 
previously evaluated accidents; thus, fuel cladding material does not 
affect the probability of occurrence of any accident. The consequences 
of none of the previously evaluated accidents were affected by fuel 
cladding material, and M5\TM\ fuel cladding, likewise, is not expected 
to have any effect on the consequences of any previously evaluated 
accidents.
    Therefore, the proposed exemption does not involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated.
    2. Does the proposed exemption create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

[[Page 46170]]

    Response: No.
    The use of M5\TM\ fuel rod cladding material will not result in 
changes in the operation or configuration of the facility. The above 
cited topical reports demonstrated that the material properties of 
M5\TM\ cladding are similar to those of standard Zircaloy. Therefore, 
M5\TM\ fuel cladding material will perform similarly to those 
fabricated from standard Zircaloy. The fuel cladding itself is not a 
postulated initiator of previously evaluated accidents and does not 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
    Therefore, the proposed exemption does not create the possibility 
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
    3. Does the proposed exemption involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    Response: No.
    The proposed exemption will not involve a significant reduction in 
the margin of safety because it has been demonstrated that the material 
properties of the M5\TM\ cladding is not significantly different from 
those of the standard Zircaloy. M5\TM\ fuel cladding material is 
expected to perform similarly to standard Zircaloy for all normal 
operating and accident scenarios. Use of M5\TM\ cladding does not 
require changing any of the current regulatory acceptance criteria, or 
relaxation of the methods of analysis.
    Therefore, the proposed exemption does not involve a significant 
reduction in a margin of safety.
    Based on the above evaluation of the standards set forth in 10 CFR 
50.92(c), the NRC staff concludes that the proposed exemption involves 
no significant hazards consideration. Accordingly, the requirements of 
10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(i) are met.
Requirements in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(ii)
    The proposed exemption would allow the use of M5\TM\ cladding at 
Millstone 3 for GAIA SBLOCA and RLBLOCA analyses performed using FRM 
methods. M5\TM\ cladding has similar properties and performance 
characteristics as the currently licensed Zircaloy cladding. Thus, the 
use of M5\TM\ fuel cladding material will not significantly increase 
the amount of effluents that may be released offsite. Therefore, the 
requirements of 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(ii) are met.
Requirements in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(iii)
    The proposed exemption would allow the use of M5\TM\ cladding at 
Millstone 3 for GAIA SBLOCA and RLBLOCA analyses performed using FRM 
methods. M5\TM\ cladding has similar properties and performance 
characteristics as the currently licensed Zircaloy cladding. Thus, the 
use of M5\TM\ fuel cladding material will not significantly increase 
individual occupational radiation exposure, or significantly increase 
cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Therefore, the requirements 
of 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9)(iii) are met.
    Based on the above, the NRC staff concludes that the proposed 
exemption meets the eligibility criteria for the categorical exclusion 
set forth in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(9). Therefore, in accordance with 10 CFR 
51.22(b), no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment 
need be prepared in connection with the NRC's issuance of this 
exemption.

IV. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12, the exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue 
risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common 
defense and security. Also, special circumstances are present. 
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants DENC an exemption from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 50.46 and 10 CFR part 50, appendix K. The 
proposed exemption request would permit application of the requirements 
of 10 CFR 50.46 and appendix K to fuel rod cladding with M5\TM\ at 
Millstone 3. As stated above, this exemption relates solely to the 
cladding material specified in these regulations.

    Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 21st day of May, 2024.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Docket Nos. 72-78, 50-317, and 50-318

Constellation Energy Generation, LLC

Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant Units 1 and 2

Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation) is the holder 
of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-53 and DPR-69, which 
authorize operation of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant (CCNPP), 
Units 1 and 2, in Lusby, Maryland, pursuant to part 50 of title 10 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities.'' The licenses provide, among 
other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, 
and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now or 
hereafter in effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. Constellation is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors 
under 10 CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for 
storage of spent fuel at the CCNPP ISFSI. Under the terms of the 
general license, Constellation stores spent fuel at its CCNPP ISFSI 
using the HI-STORM Flood/Wind (FW) Multi-Purpose Canister (MPC) Storage 
System in accordance with Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated March 22, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System [ADAMS] Accession No. ML24082A008), Constellation 
requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 
72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require 
CCNPP to comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1 (ML15152A358). If 
approved, Constellation's exemption request would accordingly allow 
CCNPP to maintain nine loaded and to load six MPCs with continuous 
basket shims (CBS) (i.e., MPC-37-CBS) in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System, and thus, to maintain and load the systems in a storage 
condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, are not met.
    Constellation currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System 
under CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, for dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in MPC-37 at the CCNPP ISFSI. Holtec International 
(Holtec), the designer and manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System, developed a variant of the design with CBS for the MPC-37, 
known as MPC-37-CBS. Holtec performed a non-mechanistic tip-over 
analysis with favorable results and implemented the CBS variant design 
under the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, tests, and 
experiments,'' which allows licensees to make changes to cask designs 
without a CoC amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 
72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, 
the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS 
variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this is not the type of change 
allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three 
Severity Level IV violations to Holtec (ML24016A190).
    Prior to the issuance of the violations, Constellation had loaded 
nine MPC-37-

[[Page 46175]]

CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, which are safely in storage 
at the CCNPP ISFSI. Constellation's near-term loading campaign for the 
CCNPP ISFSI include plans to load six MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System beginning in July 2024. While Holtec was required to 
submit a CoC amendment to the NRC to seek approval of the CBS variant 
design, such a process will not be completed in time to inform 
decisions for this near-term loading campaign. Therefore, Constellation 
submitted this exemption request in order to allow for the continued 
storage of the nine already loaded MPC-37-CBS, and future loading of 
six MPC-37-CBS beginning in July 2024 at the CCNPP ISFSI. This 
exemption is limited to the use of MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System only for the nine already loaded canisters and specific 
near-term planned loading of six new canisters using the MPC-37-CBS 
variant basket design.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow Constellation to maintain nine loaded 
and to load six MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at its 
CCNPP ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, 
are not met. Constellation is requesting an exemption from the 
provisions in 10 CFR part 72 that require the licensee to comply with 
the terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC for the approved 
cask model it uses. Section 72.7 allows the NRC to grant exemptions 
from the requirements of 10 CFR part 72. This authority to grant 
exemptions is consistent with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, and is not otherwise inconsistent with NRC's regulations or 
other applicable laws. Additionally, no other law prohibits the 
activities that would be authorized by the exemption. Therefore, the 
NRC concludes that there is no statutory prohibition on the issuance of 
the requested exemption, and the NRC is authorized to grant the 
exemption by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    This exemption would allow Constellation to maintain nine loaded 
and to load six MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the 
CCNPP ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, 
are not met. In support of its exemption request, Constellation asserts 
that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or property 
because the administrative controls the applicant has in place prevent 
a tip-over or handling event, and that the containment boundary would 
be maintained in such an event. Constellation relies, in part, on the 
approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum (ML24018A085). 
The NRC issued this Safety Determination Memorandum to address whether, 
with respect to the enforcement action against Holtec regarding this 
violation, there was any need to take an immediate action for the cask 
systems that were already loaded with non-compliant basket designs. The 
Safety Determination Memorandum documents a risk-informed approach 
concluding that, during the design basis event of a non-mechanistic 
tip-over, the fuel in the basket in the MPC-37-CBS remains in a 
subcritical condition.
    Constellation also provided site-specific technical information, 
including information explaining why the use of the approach in the 
NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum is appropriate for determining 
the safe use of the CBS variant baskets at the CCNPP ISFSI. 
Specifically, Constellation described that the analysis of the tip-over 
design basis event that is relied upon in the NRC's Safety 
Determination Memorandum, which demonstrates that the MPC confinement 
barrier is maintained, is documented in the updated final safety 
analysis report (UFSAR) for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 
1032, Amendment 1, Revision No. 1, that is used at the CCNPP site. 
Constellation also described its administrative controls for handling 
of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the CCNPP ISFSI to prevent a 
tip-over or handling event. Those controls include using single-
failure-proof handling systems as defined in Section 5.1.6 of NUREG-
0612, ``Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants'' (ML070250180). 
CCNPP's UFSAR Section 5.7 describes the spent fuel cask handling crane 
as being designated single-failure-proof using criteria from NUREG-
0554, ``Single-Failure-Proof Cranes For Nuclear Power Plants.'' 
Constellation referenced its ``Rigging and Lifting Program'' and use of 
the Lift Lock (a special lifting device designed to the increased 
stress limits of ANSI N14.6, ``for Radioactive Materials--Special 
Lifting Devices for Shipping Containers Weighing 10 000 Pounds (4500 
kg) or More'') to further demonstrate that CCNPP has applicable 
operational procedures in place to safely load, process, transfer and 
move the MPCs in accordance with the Technical Specifications in 
Appendix A of the CoC and the HI-STORM FW UFSAR.
    Additionally, Constellation provided specific information from 
CCNPP's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 3, indicating that during 
the design basis event of a non-mechanistic tip-over, CCNPP's ISFSI 
would meet the requirements in 10 CFR 72.104, ``Criteria for 
radioactive materials in effluents and direct radiation from an ISFSI 
or MRS,'' and 72.106, ``Controlled area of an ISFSI or MRS.'' 
Specifically, Constellation described that, in the highly unlikely 
event of a tip-over, any potential fuel damage from a non-mechanistic 
tip-over event would be localized, the confinement barrier would be 
maintained, and the shielding material would remain intact. Coupled 
with the distance of the CCNPP ISFSI to the site area boundary, 
Constellation concluded that compliance with 72.104 and 72.106 is not 
impacted by approving this exemption request.
    The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by Constellation 
and concludes that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or 
property because the administrative controls Constellation has in place 
at the CCNPP ISFSI sufficiently minimize the possibility of a tip-over 
or handling event, and that the containment boundary would be 
maintained in such an event. The staff confirmed that these 
administrative controls are documented in the Technical Specifications 
and UFSAR for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment 1, Revision No. 1, that is used at the CCNPP site. In 
addition, the staff confirmed that the information provided by 
Constellation regarding CCNPP's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 3, 
demonstrates that the consequences of normal and accident conditions 
would be within the regulatory limits of the 10 CFR 72.104 and 10 CFR 
72.106. The staff also determined that the requested exemption is not 
related to any aspect of the physical security or defense of the CCNPP 
ISFSI; therefore, granting the

[[Page 46176]]

exemption would not result in any potential impacts to common defense 
and security.
    For these reasons, the NRC staff has determined that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow the nine already loaded MPC-37-
CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System to remain in storage at the 
CCNPP ISFSI, and allow Constellation to load six MPC-37-CBS in the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System beginning in July 2024 at the CCNPP ISFSI, 
even though the CBS variant basket design is not part of the approved 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1. According to 
Constellation, the exemption is in the public interest because 
unloading fuel from already loaded canisters and not being able to load 
fuel into dry storage in the future loading campaign would impact 
Constellation's ability to offload fuel from the CCNPP reactor units, 
consequently impacting continued safe reactor operation. The reflooding 
of the MPCs, removal of fuel assemblies, and replacement into a 
different MPC would result in additional doses and handling operations 
with no added safety benefit. In addition, future loading campaigns 
would need to be delayed until older design canisters can be fabricated 
and delivered to the site.
    Constellation stated that to unload already loaded MPC-37-CBS or 
delay the future loading campaign would impact the ability to 
effectively manage the margin to full core discharge capability in the 
CCNPP Units 1 and 2 spent fuel pools. The low spent fuel pool 
capability would make it difficult to refuel and present potential 
risks to fuel handling operations during pre- and post-outage. In 
addition, a crowded spent fuel pool would challenge the decay heat 
removal demand of the pool and increase the likelihood of a loss of 
fuel pool cooling event and a fuel handling accident. It could also 
result in higher dose to divers routinely performing underwater 
maintenance on the spent fuel pool fuel transfer system. Furthermore, 
CCNPP planned the cask loading campaigns years in advance based on 
availability of the specialized workforce and equipment that is shared 
throughout the Constellation fleet. These specialty resources support 
competing priorities including refueling outages, loading campaigns, 
fuel pool cleanouts, fuel inspections, fuel handing equipment upgrade 
and maintenance, fuel sipping, new fuel receipt, and crane maintenance 
and upgrades. Any delays would have a cascading impact on other 
scheduled specialized activities.
    For the reasons described by Constellation in the exemption 
request, the NRC agrees that it is in the public interest to grant the 
exemption. If the exemption is not granted, in order to comply with the 
CoC, Constellation would have to unload MPC-37-CBS from the HI-STORM FW 
MPC Storage System at the CCNPP ISFSI and reload into the older design 
MPC-37 to restore compliance with terms, conditions, and specifications 
of the CoC. This would subject onsite personnel to additional radiation 
exposure, increase the risk of a possible fuel handling accident, and 
increase the risk of a possible heavy load handling accident. 
Furthermore, the removed spent fuel would need to be placed in the 
spent fuel pool until it can be loaded into another storage cask or 
remain in the spent fuel pool if it is not permitted to be loaded into 
casks for the future loading campaign. As described by Constellation, 
this scenario would affect Constellation's ability to effectively 
manage the spent pool capacity and reactor fuel offloading at CCNPP. In 
addition, the rescheduling of the specialized resources for the future 
loading campaign would impact the operations of CCNPP and other 
Constellation sites.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite, and there would be no significant increase in occupational or 
public radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The 
environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact was 
published on May 20, 2024 (89 FR 43878).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants 
Constellation an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  
72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 
with respect to the ongoing storage of nine MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM 
FW MPC Storage System and a future loading in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System of six new MPC-37-CBS beginning in July 2024.
    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 72-10; NRC-2024-0086]


Northern States Power Company; Prairie Island Independent Spent 
Fuel Storage Installation; License Amendment Application

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Opportunity to request a hearing and to petition for leave to 
intervene.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received a 
license amendment application from Northern States Power Company (NSPM) 
for an amendment to Special Nuclear Materials License No. SNM-2506 for 
the Prairie Island Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (PI 
ISFSI) located in Welch, Minnesota. The amendment request seeks to 
change License Conditions 23(a), 24(A)(2), and 24(B)(2). The subject 
license conditions are management activities with specified inspection 
intervals of three months or one quarter. The inspection intervals are 
``not to exceed every quarter'' for license condition 23 and ``not to 
exceed three months'' for license condition 24. This is inconsistent 
with similar independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) 
technical specifications (TS) surveillance requirements (SRs), for 
example, SR

[[Page 46177]]

3.1.4.1 and SR 3.1.4.2, which give the frequency as 92 days, and ISFSI 
TS SR 3.0.2, which allows up to 1.25 times the interval specified in 
the frequency. NSPM proposes to revise the license conditions to 
describe the inspection intervals similar to TS Surveillance 
Requirement Frequency, allowing up to 1.25 times the specified 
intervals to account for scheduling challenges, including but not 
limited to periods of extreme cold weather or other high-priority plant 
activities.

DATES: A request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene must 
be filed by July 29, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC received, by letter dated April 2, 2024 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24095A075), a license amendment application from NSPM, to amend 
Special Nuclear Materials License No. SNM-2506, which authorizes the 
storage of spent fuel at the PI ISFSI located in Welch, Minnesota. 
Specifically, the proposed amendment, if approved, would allow NSPM to 
perform inspections with intervals similar to TS Surveillance 
Requirement Frequency, allowing up to 1.25 times the specified 
intervals. An interval extension period will provide flexibility to 
schedule the inspections around typical challenges, including but not 
limited to inclement weather, security drills, and refueling outages. 
The proposed changes to the inspection intervals in the subject license 
conditions also make them more consistent with the ISFSI TS.
    An NRC administrative completeness review, documented in a letter 
to NSPM dated May 16, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24128A257), found the 
application acceptable to begin a technical review.
    Before any issuance of the proposed amendment, the NRC will need to 
make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended 
(the Act), and the NRC's regulations. The NRC's findings will be 
documented in a safety evaluation report. In the amendment request, 
NSPM asserted that the proposed amendment satisfies the categorical 
exclusion criteria of paragraph 51.22(c)(11) of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR). The NRC will evaluate this assertion and 
make findings consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act and 
10 CFR part 51.

II. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the NRC's ``Agency Rules of Practice and Procedure'' in 
10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 2.309. If a 
petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the petition and, 
if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

III. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other

[[Page 46178]]

adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the participant, or 
its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate). Based upon this information, the Secretary will establish 
an electronic docket for the proceeding if the Secretary has not 
already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.

I. Discussion

    On March 28, 2024, TerraPower, LLC (TerraPower), on behalf of US 
SFR Owner, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of TerraPower, filed an 
application for a construction permit for a single-unit power reactor 
facility located in Lincoln County, Wyoming, pursuant to section 103 of 
the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, and part 50 of title 10 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities.'' The single-unit facility is to be identified 
as Kemmerer Power Station, Unit 1 and would be based on the TerraPower 
and General Electric-Hitachi Natrium reactor design which is a pool-
type sodium fast reactor using metal fuel.
    The application submitted on March 28, 2024, is available in ADAMS 
under Package Accession No. ML24088A059. Along with other documents, 
the ADAMS package includes the transmittal letter (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24088A060), the preliminary safety analysis report (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24088A065), and the environmental report (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24088A072). The application was supplemented on May 2, 2024 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML24123A242). The information submitted by the applicant 
includes certain administrative information submitted pursuant to 10 
CFR 50.33, such as on financial qualifications; technical information 
submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.34; and the environmental report 
submitted pursuant to 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection 
Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions.'' 
These notices are being provided in accordance with the requirements in 
10 CFR 50.43(a)(3).
    The NRC staff is currently undertaking its acceptance review of the 
application. If the application is accepted for docketing, a subsequent 
Federal Register notice will be issued that addresses the acceptability 
of the construction permit application for docketing and provisions for 
participation of the public in the permitting process.

    Dated: May 13, 2024.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2024-0097]


Effect of Statutory Prohibition on Uranium Imports From the 
Russian Federation

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a 
notice

[[Page 45927]]

explaining how recently enacted legislation that prohibits imports of 
certain uranium products (natural uranium and low-enriched uranium) 
from the Russian Federation affects imports under NRC licenses. After 
the statutory prohibition becomes effective, importers will no longer 
be able to use the NRC general license to import these materials from 
the Russian Federation unless they first obtain a waiver from the U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE). The NRC will return any specific license 
applications for such imports without action.

DATES: May 24, 2024.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, telephone: 
301-287-9241, email: [email protected].

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NRC regulates imports of special nuclear 
material (including low-enriched uranium) and source material 
(including natural uranium) under part 110 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Export and Import of Nuclear Equipment 
and Material,'' pursuant to its authority in sections 53 and 62 of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. The NRC is providing this notice 
to inform persons who are subject to NRC regulation under 10 CFR part 
110 of recent legislation that prohibits certain uranium imports.
    On May 13, 2024, President Biden signed into law the Prohibiting 
Russian Uranium Imports Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 118-62, 138 Stat. 1022). 
The Act amends section 3112A of the United States Enrichment 
Corporation (USEC) Privatization Act (42 U.S.C. 2297h-10a) to prohibit 
imports into the United States of unirradiated low-enriched uranium and 
natural uranium that are produced in the Russian Federation or by a 
Russian entity (defined as ``an entity organized under the laws of or 
otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Government of the Russian 
Federation'').\1\ The Act also prohibits imports of unirradiated low-
enriched uranium and natural uranium that are determined to have been 
exchanged with, swapped for, or otherwise obtained in lieu of 
unirradiated low-enriched uranium or natural uranium produced in the 
Russian Federation or by a Russian entity in a manner designed to 
circumvent the import prohibition. This statutory import prohibition 
becomes effective on August 11, 2024.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ In this notice, the terms ``low-enriched uranium'' and 
``natural uranium'' have the meanings given in 10 CFR 110.2. Section 
3112A of the USEC Privatization Act (42 U.S.C. 2297h-10a(a)(5)) 
defines low-enriched uranium as any form of uranium, including 
uranium hexafluoride and uranium oxide, in which the uranium 
contains less than 20 percent uranium-235, including natural 
uranium. This statutory definition encompasses low-enriched uranium 
and natural uranium as those terms are defined in 10 CFR 110.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Act grants the Secretary of Energy the authority, for a finite 
period, to waive the import prohibition and authorize imports of 
unirradiated low-enriched uranium and natural uranium that fall within 
the statutory prohibition. A notice from the DOE describing the process 
for seeking a waiver is being published concurrently in the Federal 
Register. Imports of low-enriched uranium and natural uranium under DOE 
waivers remain subject to all applicable NRC regulations, including the 
general import license in 10 CFR 110.27.
    Accordingly, after the statutory prohibition takes effect on August 
11, 2024, the general license in 10 CFR 110.27 can no longer be used 
for imports that fall within the statutory prohibition, unless the 
importer obtains a waiver from the DOE. Additionally, specific licenses 
under 10 CFR part 110 will not be available for imports that fall 
within the prohibition. If the NRC receives any applications for such 
specific licenses, including cases where the DOE has denied a waiver 
request or because waivers are no longer available, those applications 
will be returned by the NRC without action.

    Dated: May 16, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Director, Office of International Programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    During the period from April 1, 2024, to April 30, 2024, the NRC 
granted 11 exemptions in response to requests submitted by the 
following licensees: Arizona Public Service Company; BWXT Nuclear 
Operations Group, Inc.; GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Americas, LLC; Holtec 
Decommissioning International; Kewaunee Solutions, Inc.; Nuclear Fuel 
Services, Inc.; South Texas

[[Page 45033]]

Project Nuclear Operating Company; Tennessee Valley Authority; and 
Vistra Operations Company, LLC.
    These exemptions temporarily allow the licensee to deviate from 
certain requirements of part 73 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,'' 
subpart T, ``Security Notifications, Reports, and Recordkeeping.'' In 
support of its exemption requests, the licensees agreed to effect site-
specific administrative controls that maintain the approach to 
complying with 10 CFR part 73 in effect prior to the NRC's issuance of 
a final rule, ``Enhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and 
Security Event Notifications,'' which was published in the Federal 
Register on March 14, 2023, and became effective on April 13, 2023 (88 
FR 15864).

II. Availability of Documents

    The tables in this notice provide transparency regarding the number 
and type of exemptions the NRC has issued and provide the facility 
name, docket number, document description, document date, and ADAMS

information to OMB for review entitled ``Identity, Credential, and 
Access Management System.'' The NRC hereby informs potential 
respondents that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and that a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on February 13, 2024, 89 FR 
10105.

time access is requested.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: External partners and 
members of the public that have a need to use NRC's secure web-based 
applications.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 250.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 250.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 62.5.
    10. Abstract: The NRC collects information from external partners 
and members of the public that have a need to use NRC's secure web-
based applications. An applicant can request an external partner 
digital credential using NRC's web-based credential enrollment system. 
Once the applicant has obtained an NRC digital credential, it can be 
used to access select NRC secure web-based applications directly over 
the internet. The information collected is limited to identity 
information required for credential issuance processes and includes: 
phone numbers, email addresses, physical mailing addresses, facial 
photographs, photo identity documents, date of birth, and identity 
information from a U.S. driver's license, U.S. Government PIV card, 
U.S. Passport, U.S. Military ID card, U.S. Military dependent's ID 
card, Permanent Resident card, Alien Registration Receipt card (Form I-

I. Discussion

    On March 28, 2024, TerraPower, LLC (TerraPower), on behalf of US 
SFR Owner, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of TerraPower, filed an 
application for a construction permit for a single-unit power reactor 
facility located in Lincoln County, Wyoming, pursuant to section 103 of 
the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, and part 50 of title 10 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities.'' The single-unit facility is to be identified 
as Kemmerer Power Station, Unit 1 and would be based on

[[Page 44716]]

the TerraPower and General Electric-Hitachi Natrium reactor design 
which is a pool-type sodium fast reactor using metal fuel.
    The application submitted on March 28, 2024, is available in ADAMS 
under Package Accession No. ML24088A059. Along with other documents, 
the ADAMS package includes the transmittal letter (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24088A060), the preliminary safety analysis report (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24088A065), and the environmental report (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24088A072). The application was supplemented on May 2, 2024 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML24123A242). The information submitted by the applicant 
includes certain administrative information submitted pursuant to 10 
CFR 50.33, such as on financial qualifications; technical information

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is reviewing an exemption request from Constellation, dated 
March 22, 2024. Constellation is requesting an exemption pursuant to 
section 72.7 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
in paragraphs 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require Constellation to comply with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1032, Amendment 
No. 1, Revision No. 1. If approved, the exemption would allow 
Constellation to maintain nine loaded and to load six new MPC-37-CBS in 
the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the CCNPP ISFSI in a storage 
condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, are not met.

II. Environmental Assessment

Background

    CCNPP is located near Maryland Highway 2-4 in Calvert County on the 
west bank of the Chesapeake Bay, approximately halfway between the 
mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and its headwaters at the Susquehanna 
River. Unit 1 began operating in 1975 and Unit 2 began operating in 
1977. Constellation has been storing spent fuel in an ISFSI at CCNPP 
under a general license as authorized by 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, 
``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' 
Constellation currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System under 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, for dry storage of spent 
nuclear fuel in a specific MPC (i.e., MPC-37) at the CCNPP ISFSI.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The CoC is the NRC approved design for each dry cask storage 
system. The proposed action would exempt the applicant from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 only as these requirements pertain to the use 
of the MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System for the already 
loaded systems and the near-term planned loading of the canisters. The 
exemption would allow Constellation to maintain nine loaded and to load 
six new MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the CCNPP 
ISFSI, despite the MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System not 
being in compliance with the terms, conditions, and specifications in 
the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1.
    The HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC provides the requirements, 
conditions, and operating limits necessary for use of the system to 
store spent fuel. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and 
manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, developed a variant 
of the design with CBS for the MPC-37, known as MPC-37-CBS. Holtec 
originally implemented the CBS variant design under the provisions of 
10 CFR 72.48, which allows licensees to make changes to cask designs 
without a CoC amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 
72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, 
the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS 
variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this was not the type of change 
allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three 
Severity Level IV violations to Holtec. Prior to the issuance of the 
violations, Constellation had already loaded nine MPC-37-CBS in a HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System, which are safely in storage on the CCNPP 
ISFSI pad. Additionally, Constellation plans to load six new MPC-37-CBS 
in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System beginning in July 2024. This 
exemption considers the loading of the nine already loaded systems and 
the near-term planned loading of the six canisters with the CBS variant 
basket design.

Need for the Proposed Action

    Constellation requested this exemption because Constellation is 
currently out of compliance with NRC requirements, resulting from the 
previous loading of spent fuel into a storage system with the CBS 
variant basket design. This exemption would allow nine already loaded 
MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System to remain in storage 
at the CCNPP ISFSI. The applicant also requested the exemption in order 
to allow CCNPP to load six new MPC-37-CBS in HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System at the CCNPP ISFSI for the future loading campaign beginning in 
July 2024.
    Approval of the exemption request would allow Constellation to 
effectively manage the spent fuel pool margin and capacity to enable 
refueling and offloading fuel from the reactor. It would also allow 
Constellation to effectively manage the availability of the specialized 
workforce and equipment needed to support competing fuel loading and 
operational activities at CCNPP and other Constellation sites.

[[Page 43880]]

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    This EA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting 
an exemption from the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1. The exemption would allow nine 
loaded MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System to remain 
loaded at the CCNPP ISFSI. The exemption also would allow a near-term 
loading of six new MPC-37-CBS to be loaded in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System and maintained in storage at the CCNPP ISFSI.
    The potential environmental impacts of storing spent nuclear fuel 
in NRC-approved storage systems have been documented in previous 
assessments. On July 18, 1990, the NRC amended 10 CFR part 72 to 
provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general license in cask 
designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final rule analyzed 
the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved storage 
casks. The EA for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, published in 2015, tiers off of the EA 
issued for the July 18, 1990, final rule. ``Tiering'' off earlier EAs 
is a standard process encouraged by the regulations implementing the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) that entails the use 
of impact analyses of previous EAs to bound the impacts of a proposed 
action where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System is 
designed to mitigate the effects of design basis accidents that could 
occur during storage. Considering the specific design requirements for 
the accident conditions, the design of the cask would prevent loss of 
containment, shielding, and criticality control. If there is no loss of 
containment, shielding, or criticality control, the environmental 
impacts would not be significant.
    The exemptions requested by Constellation at the CCNPP site as they 
relate to CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, for the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System are limited to the use of the CBS variant 
basket design only for the already loaded nine canisters and near-term 
planned loading of six canisters utilizing the CBS variant basket 
design. The staff has determined that this change in the basket will 
not result in either radiological or non-radiological environmental 
impacts that significantly differ from the environmental impacts 
evaluated in the EA supporting the issuance of CoC No. 1032, Amendment 
No. 1, Revision No. 1. If the exemption is granted, there will be no 
significant change in the types or amounts of any effluents released, 
no significant increase in individual or cumulative public or 
occupational radiation exposure, and no significant increase in the 
potential for or consequences from radiological accidents. Accordingly, 
the Commission concludes that there would be no significant 
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.

Alternative to the Proposed Action

    The staff considered the no-action alternative. The no-action 
alternative (denial of the exemption request) would require 
Constellation to unload spent fuel from the MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM 
FW MPC Storage System to bring it in compliance with the CoC terms, 
conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, 
Revision No. 1. Unloading the cask would subject station personnel to 
additional radiation exposure, generate additional contaminated waste, 
increase the risk of a possible fuel handling accident, and increase 
the risk of a possible heavy load handling accident. Furthermore, the 
removed spent fuel would need to be placed in the spent fuel pool, 
where it would remain until approved storage casks can be fabricated 
and delivered to site for loading. Delay in the loading of this spent 
fuel into other casks, as well as not allowing the planned future 
loading campaign, could affect Constellation's ability to effectively 
manage the spent fuel pool capacity, reactor fuel offloading, and 
refueling. It could also pose challenges to spent fuel heat removal and 
impact the availability of the specialized workforce and equipment 
needed to support competing fuel loading and operational activities at 
CCNPP and other Constellation sites. The NRC has determined that the 
no-action alternative would result in undue potential human health and 
safety impacts that could be avoided by proceeding with the proposed 
exemption, especially given that the staff has concluded in NRC's 
Safety Determination Memorandum, issued with respect to the enforcement 
action against Holtec regarding these violations, that fuel can be 
stored safety in the MPC-37-CBS canisters.

Agencies Consulted

    The NRC provided the Maryland Department of Natural Resources 
(MDNR) a copy of this draft EA for review by an email dated April 29, 
2024. On May 9, 2024, MDNR provided its concurrence by email.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action have been reviewed 
in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement 
NEPA. Based upon the foregoing EA, the NRC finds that the proposed 
action of granting the exemption from the regulations in 10 CFR 
72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11) and 72.214, 
which require the licensee to comply with the terms, conditions, and 
specifications of the CoC, in this case limited to past and specific 
future loadings of baskets with the CBS variant design, would not 
significantly impact the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, 
the NRC has determined that a FONSI is appropriate, and an 
environmental impact statement is not warranted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing a revision in the NRC's ``Regulatory Guide'' 
series. This series was developed to describe methods that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the 
agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff uses in 
evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to describe 
information that the staff needs in its review of applications for 
permits and licenses.
    Proposed Revision 1 to RG 5.87, ``Suspicious Activity Reports Under 
10 CFR part 73,'' was issued with a temporary identification of Draft 
Regulatory Guide, (DG)-5082 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23198A151).
    This revision of the guide (Revision 1) provides additional 
guidance on suspicious activity reporting. These new and updated 
requirements are part of the NRC's final rule, titled ``Enhanced 
Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and Security Event Notifications'' 
(hereafter the Enhanced Weapons rule), that was published in the 
Federal Register on March 14, 2023 (88 FR 15864). These provisions are 
found in the NRC's regulations under section 73.1215 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). Revision 1 to RG 5.87 provides 
acceptable methods that eligible applicants and licensees (collectively 
referred to as licensees in this RG) may use for reporting suspicious 
activity under NRC regulations. These provisions are found in the NRC's 
regulations under section 10 CFR 73.1215. Revision 1 to RG 5.87 
provides guidance to applicants and licensees regarding an acceptable 
approach for reporting suspicious activity to local law enforcement 
agencies, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the NRC, and the Federal 
Aviation Administration. Revision 1 to RG 5.87 also includes examples, 
considerations, and guidance to assist licensees in understanding their 
responsibilities in implementing 10 CFR 73.1215 requirements.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC published a notice of availability of DG-5082 in the 
Federal Register on October 27, 2023 (88 FR 73769) for a 45-day public 
comment period. The public comment period closed on December 11, 2023. 
The NRC staff made changes to DG-5082 in response to public comments. 
NRC staff responses to public comments on DG-5082 are available in 
ADAMS under Accession No. ML23299A192.
    In addition to the public comments received on DG-5082, the NRC 
received a public comment on DG-5080, ``Proposed Revision 3 to 
Regulatory Guide 5.62, `Physical Security Event Notifications, Reports, 
and Records,''' regarding guidance on the topic of the term ``Time of 
discovery.'' Guidance on the term ``Time of discovery'' was also 
included in DG-5082. Accordingly, the NRC has made conforming changes 
to the guidance in Revision 1 to RG 5.87 regarding the term ``Time of 
discovery'' that are consistent with Revision 3 to RG 5.62 on this same 
term.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register

to comply with publication requirements under 1 CFR chapter I.

III. Congressional Review Act

    This RG is not a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808).

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of RG 5.87, Revision 1 does not constitute backfitting as 
defined in 10 CFR 72.62, ``Backfitting''; 10 CFR 70.76, 
``Backfitting''; 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in 
NRC Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward 
Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information Requests'' (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML18093B087). Also, issuance of RG 5.87, Revision 1 does not 
constitute forward fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 
8.4; and does not affect the issue finality of any approval issued 
under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certificates, and Approvals for 
Nuclear Powerplants.''

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Docket Nos. 72-65, 50-352, and 50-353

Constellation Energy Generation, LLC.; Limerick Generating Station 
Units 1 and 2; Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation) is the holder 
of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85, which 
authorize operation of the Limerick Generating Station (LGS) Units 1 
and 2 in Limerick, Pennsylvania, pursuant to Part 50 of Title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities.'' The licenses provide, among 
other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, 
and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now or 
hereafter in effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. Constellation is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors 
under 10 CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for 
storage of spent fuel at the LGS ISFSI. Under the terms of the general 
license, Constellation stores spent fuel at its LGS ISFSI using the HI-
STORM Flood/Wind (FW) Multi-Purpose Canister (MPC) Storage System in 
accordance with Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1032, Amendment No. 
1, Revision No. 1.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated April 5, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System [ADAMS] Accession No. ML24096A137), Constellation 
requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 
72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require 
the LGS to comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1 (ML15152A358). If 
approved, Constellation's exemption request would accordingly allow the 
LGS to maintain three loaded and to load five MPCs with continuous 
basket shims (CBS) (i.e., MPC-89-CBS) in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System, and thus, to maintain and load the systems in a storage 
condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, are not met.
    Constellation currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System 
under CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, for dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in MPC-89 at the LGS ISFSI. Holtec International 
(Holtec), the designer and manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System, developed a variant of the design with CBS for the MPC-89 known 
as MPC-89-CBS. Holtec performed a non-mechanistic tip-over analysis 
with favorable results and implemented the CBS variant design under the 
provisions of 10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, tests, and experiments,'' which 
allows licensees to make changes to cask designs without a CoC 
amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After 
evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, the NRC determined 
that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS variant design under 10 
CFR 72.48, as this is not the type of change allowed without a CoC 
amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three Severity Level IV 
violations to Holtec (ML24016A190).
    Prior to the issuance of the violations, Constellation had loaded 
three MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, which are 
safely in storage at the LGS ISFSI.
    Constellation's near-term loading campaign for the LGS ISFSI 
include plans to load five MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System beginning in August 2024. While Holtec was required to submit a 
CoC

[[Page 42906]]

amendment to the NRC to seek approval of the CBS variant design, such a 
process will not be completed in time to inform decisions for this 
near-term loading campaign. Therefore, Constellation submitted this 
exemption request in order to allow for the continued storage of the 
three already loaded MPC-89-CBS, and future loading of five MPC-89-CBS 
beginning in August 2024 at the LGS ISFSI. This exemption is limited to 
the use of MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System only for 
the three already loaded canisters and specific near-term planned 
loading of five new canisters using the MPC-89-CBS variant basket 
design.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow Constellation to maintain three loaded 
and to load five MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at 
its LGS ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, 
are not met. Constellation is requesting an exemption from the 
provisions in 10 CFR part 72 that require the licensee to comply with 
the terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC for the approved 
cask model it uses. Section 72.7 allows the NRC to grant exemptions 
from the requirements of 10 CFR part 72. This authority to grant 
exemptions is consistent with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, and is not otherwise inconsistent with the NRC's regulations 
or other applicable laws. Additionally, no other law prohibits the 
activities that would be authorized by the exemption. Therefore, the 
NRC concludes that there is no statutory prohibition on the issuance of 
the requested exemption, and the NRC is authorized to grant the 
exemption by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    This exemption would allow Constellation to maintain three loaded 
and to load five MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at 
the LGS ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, 
are not met. In support of its exemption request, Constellation asserts 
that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or property 
because the administrative controls the applicant has in place prevent 
a tip-over or handling event, and that the containment boundary would 
be maintained in such an event. Constellation relies, in part, on the 
approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum (ML24018A085). 
The NRC issued this Safety Determination Memorandum to address whether, 
with respect to the enforcement action against Holtec regarding this 
violation, there was any need to take an immediate action for the cask 
systems that were already loaded with non-compliant basket designs. The 
Safety Determination Memorandum documents a risk-informed approach 
concluding that, during the design basis event of a non-mechanistic 
tip-over, the fuel in the basket in the MPC-89-CBS remains in a 
subcritical condition.
    Constellation also provided site-specific technical information, 
including information explaining why the use of the approach in the 
NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum is appropriate for determining 
the safe use of the CBS variant baskets at the LGS ISFSI. Specifically, 
Constellation described that the analysis of the tip-over design basis 
event that is relied upon in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum, 
which demonstrates that the MPC confinement barrier is maintained, is 
documented in the updated final safety analysis report (UFSAR) for the 
HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 1032, Amendment 1, Revision No. 
1, that is used at the LGS site. Constellation also described its 
administrative controls for handling of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System at the LGS ISFSI to prevent a tip-over or handling event. Those 
controls include using single-failure-proof handling systems as defined 
in Section 5.1.6 of NUREG-0612, ``Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear 
Power Plants''. The LGS's UFSAR Section 9.1.5.4 indicates that the 
single failure proof design of the reactor enclosure crane conforms to 
NUREG-0554, ``Single-Failure-Proof Cranes for Nuclear Power Plants''. 
Constellation referenced their ``Rigging and Lifting Program'', 
``Control of Heavy Loads Program'' and ``Limerick Generating Station 
Rigging and Handling Heavy Loads'' to further demonstrate that the LGS 
has applicable operational procedures in place to safely load, process, 
transfer and move the MPCs in accordance with the Technical 
Specifications in Appendix A of the CoC and the HI-STORM FW UFSAR.
    Additionally, Constellation provided specific information from the 
LGS's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 3, indicating that during the 
design basis event of a non-mechanistic tip-over, the LGS's ISFSI would 
meet the requirements in 10 CFR 72.104, ``Criteria for radioactive 
materials in effluents and direct radiation from an ISFSI or MRS,'' and 
72.106, ``Controlled area of an ISFSI or MRS.'' Specifically, 
Constellation described that, in the highly unlikely event of a tip-
over, any potential fuel damage from a non-mechanistic tip-over event 
would be localized, the confinement barrier would be maintained, and 
the shielding material would remain intact. Coupled with the distance 
of the LGS ISFSI to the site area boundary, Constellation concluded 
that compliance with 72.104 and 72.106 is not impacted by approving 
this exemption request.
    The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by Constellation 
and concludes that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or 
property because the administrative controls Constellation has in place 
at the LGS ISFSI sufficiently minimize the possibility of a tip-over or 
handling event, and that the containment boundary would be maintained 
in such an event. The staff confirmed that these administrative 
controls are documented in the technical specifications and UFSAR for 
the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 1032, Amendment 1, Revision 
No. 1, that is used at the LGS site. In addition, the staff confirmed 
that the information provided by Constellation regarding the LGS's 
72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 3, demonstrates that the 
consequences of normal and accident conditions would be within the 
regulatory limits of the 10 CFR 72.104 and 10 CFR 72.106. The staff 
also determined that the requested exemption is not related to any 
aspect of the physical security or defense of the LGS ISFSI; therefore, 
granting the exemption would not result in any potential impacts to 
common defense and security.
    For these reasons, the NRC staff has determined that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or

[[Page 42907]]

property or the common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow the three already loaded MPC-89-
CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System to remain in storage at the 
LGS ISFSI and allow Constellation to load five MPC-89-CBS in the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System beginning in August 2024 at the LGS ISFSI, 
even though the CBS variant basket design is not part of the approved 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1. According to 
Constellation, the exemption is in the public interest because 
unloading fuel from already loaded canisters and not being able to load 
fuel into dry storage in future loading campaigns would impact 
Constellation's ability to offload fuel from the LGS reactor units, 
consequently impacting continued safe reactor operation. The reflooding 
of the MPCs, removal of fuel assemblies, and replacement into a 
different MPC would result in additional doses and handling operations 
with no added safety benefit. In addition, future loading campaigns 
would need to be delayed until older design canisters can be fabricated 
and delivered to the site.
    Constellation stated that to unload already loaded MPC-89-CBS or 
delay the future loading campaigns would impact the ability to 
effectively manage the margin to full core discharge capacity in the 
LGS Units 1 and 2 spent fuel pools. The low spent fuel pool capacity 
would make it difficult to refuel and present potential risks to fuel 
handling operations during pre- and post-outage. In addition, a crowded 
spent fuel pool would challenge the decay heat removal demand of the 
pool and increase the likelihood of a loss of fuel pool cooling event 
and a fuel handling accident. Furthermore, the LGS planned the cask 
loading campaigns years in advance based on availability of the 
specialized workforce and equipment that is shared throughout the 
Constellation fleet. These specialty resources support competing 
priorities including refueling outages, loading campaigns, fuel pool 
cleanouts, fuel inspections, fuel handing equipment upgrade and 
maintenance, fuel sipping, new fuel receipt, and crane maintenance and 
upgrades. Any delays would have a cascading impact on other scheduled 
specialized activities.
    For the reasons described by Constellation in the exemption 
request, the NRC agrees that it is in the public interest to grant the 
exemption. If the exemption is not granted, in order to comply with the 
CoC, Constellation would have to unload MPC-89-CBS from the HI-STORM FW 
MPC Storage System at the LGS ISFSI and reload into the older design 
MPC-89 to restore compliance with terms, conditions, and specifications 
of the CoC. This would subject onsite personnel to additional radiation 
exposure, increase the risk of a possible fuel handling accident, and 
increase the risk of a possible heavy load handling accident. 
Furthermore, the removed spent fuel would need to be placed in the 
spent fuel pool until it can be loaded into another storage cask or 
remain in the spent fuel pool if it is not permitted to be loaded into 
casks for future loading campaigns. As described by Constellation, this 
scenario would affect Constellation's ability to effectively manage the 
spent pool capacity and reactor fuel offloading at the LGS. In 
addition, the rescheduling of the specialized resources for the future 
loading campaigns would impact the operations of the LGS and other 
Constellation sites.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite, and there would be no significant increase in occupational or 
public radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The 
environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact was 
published on May 8, 2024 (89 FR 38921).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants 
Constellation an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  
72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 
with respect to the ongoing storage of three MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM 
FW MPC Storage System and a future loading in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System of five new MPC-89-CBS beginning in August 2024.
    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

II. Discussion

    General Electric (GE) Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH, the licensee) is 
the holder of Facility Operating License, DPR-1. The license provides, 
among other things, that the GEH Vallecitos Boiling Water Reactor 
(VBWR) is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the NRC now 
or hereafter in effect. The VBWR is a boiling water reactor located at 
the GEH Vallecitos Nuclear Center (VNC) in Sunol, CA.
    The license, DPR-1, was issued to GE on August 31, 1957, and full 
power was attained on October 19, 1957. The VBWR ceased operations on 
December 9, 1963, and was defueled on December 24 of that year. GE was 
issued a license to possess but not operate the VBWR reactor on 
September 9, 1965. The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission issued GE an order 
to dismantle the VBWR on July 25, 1966. However, the VBWR was put into 
a safe storage configuration and major decommissioning activities at 
the VBWR did not occur until 2007-2008 with the removal of most of the 
contaminated equipment and components. The reactor vessel was the last 
remaining component of the VBWR reactor. The reactor vessel was removed 
and disposed of offsite in 2023. What remains of the VBWR is the empty 
reactor building with residual structural contamination and 
contaminated embedded piping.
    The VBWR LTP describes a strategy for terminating the VBWR license 
by transferring the residual contamination of the VBWR to the NRC 
license (DR-10) for the Empire State Atomic Development Agency (ESADA) 
Vallecitos Experimental Superheat Reactor (EVESR), that is adjacent to 
the VBWR. This strategy will require approval of an exemption to 
paragraph 50.82(a)(11)(ii) of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) that will allow the VBWR license to be terminated 
without demonstrating that the facility and site have met the residual 
contamination criteria for license termination in 10 CFR 20, subpart E. 
This is because the VBWR residual contamination would be transferred to 
the EVESR license by amending the EVESR license. When the DPR-1 license 
is terminated, the VBWR facility and all in-situ residual contamination 
will be included in the EVESR license. The VBWR LTP describes that an 
LTP for the EVESR will be submitted later, that will include the 
residual contamination of the VBWR, and describe meeting the residual 
contamination requirements of 10 CFR 20, subpart E. This will allow for 
the termination of the EVESR DR-10 license by April 15, 2030.
    The VBWR license, and the other GE licensed facilities at the VNC, 
were transferred from GE to GEH in 2007. By letter dated September 1, 
2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23244A247), GEH and NorthStar Vallecitos, 
LLC (NorthStar Vallecitos) have requested that the GEH licenses at the 
VNC (including the license for the VBWR) be transferred to NorthStar 
Vallecitos for decommissioning. This request is still under review by 
the NRC but may be granted by the time of this public meeting. If so, 
the VBWR licensee will then be NorthStar Vallecitos. By letter dated 
September 7, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23250A267), as supplemented by 
letter dated September 15, 2023 (ADAMS Package Accession No. 
ML23261A591), and March 25, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24085A792), and 
email dated October 31, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23304A300), GEH 
submitted the LTP for the VBWR.
    According to the requirements in 10 CFR 50.82(a)(9)(iii), after the 
licensee submits an LTP the NRC must hold a public meeting near the 
site. The purpose of the meeting is for the NRC staff to discuss the 
NRC's review of the LTP, to solicit public comments on the LTP, and to 
describe how comments can be submitted to NRC. In addition, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(9)(iii) and 20.1405, upon the receipt 
of an LTP from a licensee, NRC must publish a notice in the Federal 
Register and solicit comments from affected parties.

III. Request for Comment and Public Meeting

    The NRC is requesting public comments on the VBWR LTP. The NRC will 
conduct a public meeting to discuss the LTP and receive comments on 
Tuesday, May 21, 2024, from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., PDT. The public meeting 
will be held at SpringHill Suites Pleasanton, 7270 Johnson Drive, 
Pleasanton, CA 94588. Please contact Jack Parrott no later than May 17, 
2024, if accommodations or special equipment are needed for you to 
attend or to provide comments, so that the NRC staff can determine 
whether the request can be accommodated.
    For additional information regarding the meeting, see the NRC's 
Public Meeting Schedule website at https://meetings.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg. 
The agenda and links to participate by webinar or phone will be posted 
no later than 10 days prior to the meeting.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 72-69, and 50-440; NRC-2024-0082]

Vistra Operations Company LLC; Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1; 
Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    Vistra Operations Company LLC (VistraOps) is the holder of Facility 
Operating License No. NPF-58, which authorizes operation of the Perry 
Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1 (Perry) in North Perry, Ohio, pursuant to 
part 50 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities.'' The 
license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to 
all rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC) now or hereafter in effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. VistraOps is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors 
under 10 CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for 
storage of spent fuel at the Perry ISFSI. Under the terms of the 
general license, VistraOps stores spent fuel at its Perry ISFSI using 
the HI-STORM Flood/Wind (F/W) Multipurpose Canister (MPC) Storage 
System in accordance with Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 5.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated February 27, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access 
and Management System [ADAMS] ML24058A180), by Energy Harbor Nuclear 
Corporation \1\ and supplemented by VistraOps on March 22, 2024 
(ML24082A132), VistraOps requested an exemption from the requirements 
of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), 
and 72.214 that require Perry to comply with the terms, conditions, and 
specifications of the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5 (ML20163A701). If 
approved, the VistraOps exemption request would accordingly allow Perry 
to load two Multi-Purpose Canisters (MPC) with an unapproved variant 
basket design with continuous basket shims (CBS) (i.e., MPC-89-CBS), in 
the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System beginning in August, 2024, and 
thus, to load the systems in a storage condition where the terms, 
conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5 are 
not met.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Effective March 1, 2024, the facility operating license for 
Perry Nuclear Power Plant was transferred from Energy Harbor Nuclear 
Generation LLC (owner) and Energy Harbor Nuclear Corp. (operator) to 
Energy Harbor Nuclear Generation LLC (owner) and Vistra Operations 
Company LLC (ADAMS Accession No. ML24057A075). Upon completion of 
this license transfer, Vistra Operations Company LLC (VistraOps) 
assumed the responsibility for all licensing actions under NRC 
review at the time of the transfer and requested that the NRC 
continue its review of these actions (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24054A498).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    VistraOps currently uses the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System under 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at 
the Perry ISFSI. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and 
manufacturer of the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System, developed a 
variant of the design with CBS for the MPC-89, known as MPC-89-CBS. 
Holtec performed a non-mechanistic tip-over analysis with favorable 
results and implemented the CBS variant design under the provisions of 
10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, tests, and experiments,'' which allows 
licensees to make changes to cask designs without a CoC amendment under 
certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After evaluating the 
specific changes to the cask designs, the NRC determined that Holtec 
erred when it implemented the CBS variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as 
this is not the type of change allowed without a CoC amendment. For 
this reason, the NRC issued three Severity Level IV violations to 
Holtec (ML24016A190).
    VistraOps's near-term loading campaign for the Perry ISFSI, in 
addition to other loadings of non-CBS MPCs, also includes plans to load 
two MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System in August 2024. 
While Holtec was required to submit a CoC amendment to the NRC to seek 
approval of the CBS variant design, such a process will not be 
completed in time to inform decisions for this near-term loading 
campaign. Therefore, VistraOps submitted this exemption request in 
order to allow for the future loadings of the two MPC-89-CBS canisters 
beginning in August 2024 at the Perry ISFSI. This exemption is limited 
to the use of two MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System for 
the specific near-term planned loading beginning in August 2024.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow VistraOps to load two MPC-89-CBS 
canisters in the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System beginning in August 
2024 at its Perry ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, 
conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, 
are not met. VistraOps is requesting an exemption from the provisions 
in 10 CFR part 72

[[Page 42513]]

that require the licensee to comply with the terms, conditions, and 
specifications of the CoC for the approved cask model it uses. Section 
72.7 allows the NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR 
part 72. This authority to grant exemptions is consistent with the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and is not otherwise 
inconsistent with NRC's regulations or other applicable laws. 
Additionally, no other law prohibits the activities that would be 
authorized by the exemption. Therefore, the NRC concludes that there is 
no statutory prohibition on the issuance of the requested exemption, 
and the NRC is authorized to grant the exemption by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    This exemption would allow VistraOps to load two MPC-89-CBS in the 
HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System beginning in August 2024 at the Perry 
ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No.5 are not met. In 
support of its exemption request, VistraOps asserts that issuance of 
the exemption would not endanger life or property because a tip-over or 
handling event is administratively controlled, and that the containment 
boundary would be maintained in such an event. VistraOps relies, in 
part, on the approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum 
(ML24018A085). The NRC issued this Safety Determination Memorandum to 
address whether, with respect to the enforcement action against Holtec 
regarding this violation, there was any need to take an immediate 
action for the cask systems that were already loaded with non-compliant 
basket designs. The Safety Determination Memorandum documents a risk-
informed approach concluding that, during the design basis event of a 
non-mechanistic tip-over, the fuel in the basket in the MPC-89-CBS 
remains in a subcritical condition.
    VistraOps also provided site-specific technical information, as 
supplemented, including information explaining why the use of the 
approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum is appropriate 
for determining the safe use of the CBS variant baskets at the Perry 
ISFSI. Specifically, VistraOps described that the analysis of the tip-
over design basis event that is relied upon in the NRC's Safety 
Determination Memorandum, which demonstrates that the MPC confinement 
barrier is maintained, is documented in the updated final safety 
analysis report (UFSAR) for the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 5 that is used at the Perry site. VistraOps also 
described its administrative controls for handling of the HI-STORM F/W 
MPC Storage System at the Perry ISFSI to prevent a tip-over or handling 
event. Those controls include ensuring that all lifts of the cask will 
be conducted in accordance with Perry's existing heavy load program. 
The fuel handling building crane at Perry was upgraded to single 
failure proof. Also, evaluations pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, ``Changes, 
tests and experiments,'' have been performed demonstrating that heavy 
load lifts and the use of the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System are in 
compliance with Perry's existing heavy load requirements. In addition, 
transportation of a loaded HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System into and out 
the fuel handling building is accomplished using a zero profile 
transporter with Hilman rollers that provides support from underneath. 
The applicant stated that transportation of a loaded HI-STORM storage 
cask between the fuel handling building and the ISFSI is accomplished 
by the Holtec HI-TRAN, which meets the requirements of CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 5. VistraOps provided information from ``Perry Nuclear 
Power Plant 10 CFR 72.212 Evaluation Report,'' Revision 2, which 
evaluated the seismic stability of the transport of the overpack and 
during stackup. VistraOps report concluded that both HI-STORM/HI-TRAC 
Stackup and transfer of the loaded HI-STORM overpack by HI-TRAN remains 
kinematically stable and does not overturn during a seismic event.
    Additionally, VistraOps provided specific information from Perry's 
site evaluation from its ``Perry Nuclear Power Plant 10 CFR 72.212 
Evaluation Report,'' Revision 2, which states that during the design 
basis event of a non-mechanistic tip-over, Perry's ISFSI would meet the 
requirements in 10 CFR 72.106, ``Controlled area of an ISFSI or MRS 
[monitored retrievable storage installation].'' Specifically, VistraOps 
stated that section 12.2 of the UFSAR for the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage 
System shows that there are no accidents that significantly affect the 
shielding analyses. In addition, the minimum distance from the ISFSI to 
the site boundary at the Perry ISFSI is 428 meters, compared to the 
100-meter distance in the UFSAR. In the highly unlikely event of a tip-
over, any potential fuel damage from a non-mechanistic tip-over event 
would be localized, the confinement barrier would be maintained, and 
the storage cask shielding material would remain intact. Coupled with 
the distance of the Perry ISFSI to the site area boundary, VistraOps 
concluded that compliance with Sec. Sec.  72.104, ``Criteria for 
radioactive materials in effluents and direct radiation from an ISFSI 
or MRS,'' and 72.106 is not impacted by approving this exemption 
request.
    The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by VistraOps and 
concludes that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or 
property because the administrative controls VistraOps has in place at 
the Perry ISFSI sufficiently minimize the possibility of a tip-over or 
handling event, and that the containment boundary would be maintained 
if such an event were to occur. The staff confirmed that the technical 
specifications for the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, for the HI-STORM 
F/W MPC Storage System used at the Perry site contain restrictions on 
lifting the transfer cask or storage cask when loaded with fuel. 
Specifically, technical specification 5.2.c.2 authorizes lifting to any 
height as long as the horizontal cross beam and any lifting attachments 
used to connect the load to the lifting equipment are designed, 
fabricated, operated, tested, inspected, and maintained in accordance 
with applicable sections and guidance of NUREG-0612, ``Control of Heavy 
Loads at Nuclear Power Plants: Resolution of Generic Technical Activity 
A-36,'' Section 5.1, including applicable stress limits from American 
National Standards Institute N14.6, ``Radioactive Materials--Special 
Lifting Devices For Shipping Containers Weighing 10 000 Pounds (4500 
Kg) Or More.'' In addition, the staff confirmed that the information 
provided by VistraOps regarding Revision 2 of the ``Perry Nuclear Power 
Plant 10 CFR 72.212 Evaluation Report,'' demonstrates that the 
consequences of normal and accident conditions would be within the 
regulatory limits of the 10 CFR 72.104 and 10 CFR 72.106. The staff 
also determined that the requested exemption is not related to any 
aspect of the physical security or defense of the Perry ISFSI; 
therefore, granting the exemption would not result in any potential 
impacts to common defense and security.
    For these reasons, the NRC staff has determined that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or

[[Page 42514]]

property or the common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow VistraOps to load two MPC-89-CBS 
in the HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System in August 2024, at the Perry 
ISFSI, even though the CBS variant basket design is not part of the 
approved CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5. According to VistraOps, the 
exemption is in the public interest because not being able to load fuel 
into the two MPC-89-CBS baskets during the August 2024 loading 
campaigns would impact VistraOps's ability at Perry to maintain full-
core offload capability, consequently increasing risk and challenges to 
continued safe reactor operation.
    VistraOps stated that to delay the August 2024 loading of the two 
MPC-89-CBS baskets at Perry would impact the ability to maintain a 
healthy margin in the spent fuel pool in support of a full-core 
discharge capability. VistraOps stated that not loading the two MPC-89-
CBS spent fuel canisters for storage on the ISFSI pad in August 2024, 
decreases the margin to full-core offload to 555 open cells in the 
spent fuel pool. There are two refueling outages planned for 2025 and 
2027 that would decrease the full-core offload margin to an 
insufficient number of open fuel cells (a deficit of 25 open cells) due 
to the planned discharges of 288 and 292 fuel bundles, respectively. 
That is, the Perry spent fuel pool would lose full-core offload in 2027 
and would not regain full-core offload, and margin to full-core 
offload, until the 2028 spent fuel loading campaign. Having no full-
core offload capability for over a year of operation at Perry is an 
unnecessary risk to the operation of the plant, spent fuel pool 
inventory and operations. In order to regain full-core offload prior to 
the 2028 spent fuel loading campaign, non-fuel components stored in the 
pool would need to be relocated, which involves additional resources, 
dose, and risk to perform the relocations.
    For the reasons described by VistraOps in its exemption request, 
the NRC agrees that it is in the public interest to grant the 
exemption. If the exemption is not granted, in order to comply with the 
CoC, VistraOps would have to keep spent fuel in the spent fuel pool if 
it is not permitted to be loaded into casks in the August 2024 spent 
fuel loading, thus impacting Perry's ability to effectively manage the 
margin for full-core discharge capacity. As explained by VistraOps, 
increased inventory of fuel in the spent fuel pool could result in the 
need for relocation or movement of non-fuel components and, therefore, 
an increase in worker doses and the potential for accidents that 
accompany increased movement of radioactive material. Moreover, should 
spent fuel pool capacity be reached, the ability to refuel the 
operating reactor unit is challenged, thus potentially impacting 
continued reactor operations.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite, and there would be no significant increase in occupational or 
public radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The 
environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact was 
published on May 8, 2024 (89 FR 38926).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants VistraOps 
an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212(a)(2), 
72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 with respect 
to the loading of two HI-STORM F/W MPC Storage System in MPC-89-CBS 
beginning in August 2024.
    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

    Dated: May 8, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

A. Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) Security 
Requirements Rulemaking

    In SECY-07-0148, ``Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation 
Requirements for Radiological Sabotage,'' dated August 28, 2007, the 
NRC staff proposed to develop new security requirements to update the 
security regulations for ISFSIs. Following subsequent analysis, as 
directed by the Commission in staff requirements memorandum (SRM) SRM-
COMKLS-18-003, ``Fiscal Year 2020 Budget to the Commission,'' dated 
August 22, 2018, and SRM-SECY-19-0100, ``Discontinuation of Rulemaking-
Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation Security Requirements,'' 
dated August 4, 2021, the staff provided SECY-22-0098, ``Rulemaking 
Options for Revising Security Requirements for Facilities Storing Spent 
Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste.''
    In SECY-22-0098, the staff outlined its determination that the 
current regulatory framework, including the additional requirements in 
the post-9/11 security orders, provides reasonable assurance of 
adequate protection of public health and safety for facilities storing 
spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste and recommended 
that the Commission approve discontinuing the rulemaking directed by 
the Commission in SRM-SECY-07-0148, ``Staff Requirements--SECY-07-
0148--Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation Security Requirements 
for Radiological Sabotage.'' In SRM-SECY-22-0098, dated October 4, 
2023, the Commission approved discontinuing the rulemaking.

B. Petition for Rulemaking

    Section 2.802 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR), ``Petition for rulemaking,'' provides an opportunity for any 
interested person to petition the Commission to issue, amend, or 
rescind any regulation. On November 24, 2008, the NRC received a PRM 
filed by Sandra Gavutis (the petitioner), Executive Director of C-10 
Research and Education Foundation, Inc. The petitioner requested that 
the NRC amend its regulations concerning dry cask safety, security, 
transferability, and longevity. The petitioner made 12 specific 
requests in the petition. The NRC docketed the petition as PRM-72-6 and 
documented it in the Federal Register for public comment on March 3, 
2009 (74 FR 9178). The staff discussed its review of the petition and 
the comments received in SECY-12-0079, ``Partial Closure of Petition 
for Rulemaking (PRM-72-6) C-10 Research and Education Foundation, 
Inc.,'' dated June 1, 2012. The Commission approved the staff's 
recommendation for partial closure of the PRM in SRM-SECY-12-0079, 
dated September 7, 2012. In a Federal Register document dated October 
16, 2012 (77 FR 63254), the NRC denied 9 of the petitioner's 12 
specific requests (Requests 1-3, 5-8, 10, and 12), reserved 2 requests 
for future

[[Page 41902]]

rulemaking determination (Requests 4 and 9), and accepted 1 request 
(Request 11) for consideration as part of the ISFSI security 
requirements rulemaking effort. Subsequently, the NRC announced its 
final decision to deny Requests 4 and 9 in the Federal Register on June 
24, 2016 (81 FR 41258). As stated in the petition, Request 11 in PRM-
72-6 requested that the NRC amend its regulations to do the following:

    [R]equire Hardened On-Site Storage (HOSS) at all nuclear power 
plants as well as away-from-reactor dry cask storage sites: that all 
nuclear industry interim on-site or off-site dry cask storage 
installations or ISFSIs be fortified against attack. In addition all 
sites should be safeguarded against accident and age-related 
leakage.

    In SECY-19-0100, the staff recommended that the Commission deny 
Request 11 in PRM-72-6. Following the receipt of SRM-SECY-22-0098, the 
NRC staff submitted SECY-24-0006, ``Denial of Request 11 in PRM-72-6 as 
Part of Notice Discontinuing Independent Spent Fuel Storage 
Installation Security Requirements Rulemaking,'' dated January 22, 
2024. In SRM-SECY-24-0006, dated January 31, 2024, the Commission 
approved the staff's recommendation.

II. Discussion

A. Discontinuation of Rulemaking Activity

    In SRM-SECY-22-0098, dated October 4, 2023, the Commission approved 
discontinuing the rulemaking. The NRC finds that the current regulatory 
framework provides reasonable assurance of adequate protection of 
public health and safety for facilities storing spent nuclear fuel and 
high-level radioactive waste, regardless of the ISFSI license type or 
location. The NRC's experience shows that the staff, licensees, 
applicants, and other stakeholders have been able to understand and 
apply the existing ISFSI security requirements, and the NRC has 
successfully addressed the appropriate security considerations for new 
license applicants on a case-by-case basis.

B. Denial of Petition for Rulemaking

    Following the receipt of SRM-SECY-22-0098, the NRC staff submitted 
SECY-24-0006, ``Denial of Request 11 In PRM-72-6 as Part of Notice 
Discontinuing Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation Security 
Requirements Rulemaking,'' dated January 22, 2024. The staff 
recommended that the Commission deny Request 11 in PRM-72-6. The staff 
also noted that, in the 2012 Federal Register document that accepted 
Request 11 for consideration within the context of the ISFSI security 
rulemaking effort (77 FR 63254, 63256), the NRC stated that it has not 
mandated hardened on-site storage because the NRC ``has, consistently, 
found that the robust nature of dry cask storage systems approved by 
the NRC under 10 CFR part 72 assures the protection of public health, 
safety, and security.'' This statement was made in 2012 in response to 
public comments on Request 11. In SRM-SECY-24-0006, dated January 31, 
2024, the Commission approved the staff's recommendation. The NRC is 
denying Request 11 in PRM-72-6 because the NRC has found that the 
existing security requirements for ISFSIs, together with the additional 
requirements in the post-9/11 security orders, provide reasonable 
assurance of adequate protection of public health and safety.

IV. Conclusion

    The NRC is discontinuing the ISFSI security requirements rulemaking 
and is denying Request 11 in PRM-72-6 for the reasons discussed in this 
document. In the next edition of the Unified Agenda, the NRC will 
update the entry for this rulemaking activity and reference this 
document to indicate that the rulemaking activity is no longer being 
pursued. This rulemaking activity will appear in the Completed Actions 
section of that edition of the Unified Agenda but will not appear in 
future editions. If the NRC decides to pursue

[[Page 41903]]

similar or related rulemaking activities in the future, it will inform 
the public through new rulemaking entries in the Unified Agenda.

    Dated: May 2, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses and Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination

    For the facility-specific amendment requests shown in this notice, 
the Commission finds that the licensees' analyses provided, consistent 
with section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) ``Notice for public comment; State consultation,'' are sufficient 
to support the proposed determinations that these amendment requests 
involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, 
operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments 
would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves NSHC. In addition, the Commission may issue any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period 
if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that 
failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or 
shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice 
of issuance. If the Commission makes a final NSHC determination for any 
of these amendments, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take action on any amendment before 
60 days have elapsed will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).

[[Page 41998]]

    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still

III. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Combined Licenses

    During the period since publication of the last monthly notice, the 
Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has 
determined for each of these amendments that the application complies 
with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The 
Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    A notice of consideration of issuance of amendment to facility 
operating license or combined license, as applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing in connection with these 
actions, were published in the Federal Register as indicated in the 
safety evaluation for each amendment.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that 
these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.22(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to each action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession numbers for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

IV. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses and 
Combined Licenses and Final Determination of No Significant Hazards 
Consideration and Opportunity for a Hearing (Exigent Circumstances or 
Emergency Situation)

    Since publication of the last monthly notice, the Commission has 
issued the following amendment. The Commission has determined for this 
amendment that the application for the amendment complies with the 
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended 
(the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission 
has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    Because of exigent circumstances or emergency situation associated 
with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the 
Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 
notice of consideration of issuance of amendment, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing.
    In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have 
resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant 
or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in 
power output up to the plant's licensed power level (an emergency 
situation), the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide 
for public comment on its NSHC determination. In such case, the license 
amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment prior to 
issuance. Nonetheless, the State has been consulted by telephone 
whenever possible.
    Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an 
amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it 
of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding 
and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that 
NSHC is involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 
50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment(s) involves 
NSHC. The basis for this determination is contained in the NRC staff 
safety evaluation related to each action. Accordingly, the amendment 
has been issued and made effective as indicated. For those amendments 
that have not been previously noticed in the Federal Register, within 
60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any persons 
(petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may file a 
request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene (petition) 
with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in accordance with 
the guidance concerning the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2 as discussed in section II.A of this 
document.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that the 
amendment satisfies the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for this amendment. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to this action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession number 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession number(s) for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

I. Discussion

    On March 28, 2024, TerraPower, LLC (TerraPower), on behalf of US 
SFR Owner, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of TerraPower, filed an 
application for a construction permit for a single-unit power reactor 
facility located in Lincoln County, Wyoming, pursuant to section 103 of 
the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, and part 50 of title 10 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities.'' The single-unit facility is to be identified 
as Kemmerer Power Station, Unit 1 and would be based on the TerraPower 
and General Electric-Hitachi Natrium reactor design which is a pool-
type sodium fast reactor using metal fuel.
    The application submitted on March 28, 2024, is available in ADAMS 
under Package Accession No. ML24088A059. Along with other documents, 
the ADAMS package includes the transmittal letter (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24088A060), the preliminary safety analysis report (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24088A065), and the environmental report (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24088A072). The application was supplemented on May 2, 2024 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML24123A242). The information submitted by the applicant 
includes certain administrative information submitted pursuant to 10 
CFR 50.33, such as on financial qualifications; technical information 
submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50.34; and the environmental report 
submitted pursuant to 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection 
Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions.'' 
These notices are being provided in accordance with the requirements in 
10 CFR 50.43(a)(3).
    The NRC staff is currently undertaking its acceptance review of the 
application. If the application is accepted for docketing, a subsequent 
Federal Register notice will be issued that addresses the acceptability 
of the construction permit application for docketing and provisions for 
participation of the public in the permitting process.

    Dated: May 8, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC staff is considering the approval of an update to a PCSP 
held by GLE for operations at a new headquarters, located in 
Wilmington, NC, approximately 6.2 miles from GLE's existing test loop 
facility. Therefore, as required by section 51.21 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Criteria for and identification 
of licensing and regulatory actions requiring environmental 
assessments,'' the NRC staff has prepared an EA that analyzes the 
environmental effects of the proposed action. Based on the results of 
the EA and in accordance with 10 CFR 51.31(a), the NRC staff is issuing 
a FONSI for the proposed update to the PCSP.
    Approval of the updated PCSP would allow for the incorporation of 
classified systems at the new headquarters building into the existing 
GLE authorization to operate a classified network. The request for 
approval of an updated PCSP was submitted September 21, 2023, and 
updated November 13, 2023. The NRC staff is also considering the 
approval of a separate but related request for issuance of a facility 
clearance under 10 CFR part 95 for GLE's new headquarters building, 
published in the Federal Register on April 29, 2024 (89 FR 33404).

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would allow GLE to extend the classified 
computer network to a new headquarters location approximately 6.2 miles 
from the test loop. As proposed, GLE would continue to possess, use, 
and store classified matter at its test loop facility and would also 
possess, use, and store classified matter at the new headquarters 
location under the revised PCSP. GLE operates a test loop for 
industrialization of the uranium enrichment process that uses 
separation of isotopes by laser excitation. Although GLE has an NRC-
issued facility security clearance for the test loop facility under 10 
CFR part 95 for protection of classified matter, the facility's 
operations, safety, and safeguards programs are authorized under the 
Global Nuclear Fuel--America license SNM-1097.

Need for the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would allow GLE to extend the classified 
computer network to a new headquarters location to facilitate further 
research and development potentially leading to the industrialization 
of the laser enrichment process. The proposed NRC staff approval of the 
updated PCSP would add approval for the possession and use of 
classified matter at the new headquarters location.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff has assessed the potential environmental impacts from 
GLE's updated PCSP. The classified systems at the headquarters building 
will include appropriate controls for the protection of classified 
matter. These headquarter systems will facilitate the exchange of 
classified matter with the test loop facility but will have no 
operational or environmental impacts on the test loop. The NRC staff 
evaluated the potential for impacts at the GLE headquarters facility 
from the proposed action, which involves only changes to information 
systems. The NRC staff concluded that the proposed action will cause no 
significant change in the types of or significant increase in the 
amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite, that there will 
be no significant increase in individual or cumulative occupational 
radiation exposure, that there will be no significant construction 
impact, and that there will be no significant increase in the potential 
for or consequences from radiological accidents. The NRC staff assessed 
the impacts of the proposed action on land use; historical and cultural 
resources; visual and scenic resources; climatology, meteorology and 
air quality; geology, minerals, and soils; water resources; ecological 
resources; socioeconomics; noise; traffic and transportation; public 
and occupational health and safety; and waste management and concluded 
that the proposed action would have no significant environmental 
impacts on these resource areas. The NRC staff

[[Page 39663]]

determined that there are no cumulative impacts associated with the 
proposed action.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Under this alternative, GLE would not be granted approval of the 
updated cyber security plan. Denial of the proposed action would result 
in GLE being unable to conduct operations related to classified matter 
at its headquarters location. GLE would continue its current operations 
at the test loop facility. The NRC staff concluded that environmental 
impacts from the no-action alternative would not be significant.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted to prevent further 
decline of endangered and threatened species and restore those species 
and their critical habitat. Section 7 of the ESA requires Federal 
agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, regarding actions 
that may affect listed species or designated critical habitats. The NRC 
staff has determined that the proposed action would have no effect on 
threatened or endangered species or critical habitat. Therefore, 
consultation under section 7 of the ESA is not required.
    Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) 
requires Federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings 
on historic properties. As stated in the NHPA, historic properties are 
any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or 
object included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register 
of Historic Places. The NRC staff has determined that the undertaking 
is a type of activity that does not have the potential to cause effects 
on any historic properties that may be present. Therefore, in 
accordance with 36 CFR 800.3(a)(1), the NRC has no further obligations 
under section 106 of the NHPA.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    GLE has requested approval of its updated PCSP. The NRC staff has 
prepared an EA as part of its review of the proposed action. The 
proposed action would have no significant radiological or non-
radiological impacts to environmental resources. This FONSI 
incorporates by reference the EA in Section II of this notice. On the 
basis of this EA, the NRC staff concludes that the proposed action will 
not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. 
Accordingly, the NRC has determined not to prepare an environmental 
impact statement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is reviewing an exemption request from Constellation, dated 
April 5, 2024. Constellation is requesting an exemption, pursuant to 
section 72.7 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
in paragraphs 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require Constellation to comply with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1032, Amendment 
No. 1, Revision No. 1. If approved, the exemption would allow 
Constellation to maintain three loaded and to load five new MPC-89-CBS 
in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the LGS ISFSI in a storage 
condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, are not met.

II. Environmental Assessment

Background

    The LGS is located in Limerick Township of Montgomery County, 
Pennsylvania, 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) southeast of the Borough of 
Pottstown. Unit 1 began operating in 1986 and Unit 2 began operating in 
1990. Constellation has been storing spent fuel in an ISFSI at the LGS 
under a general license as authorized by 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, 
``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' 
Constellation currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System under 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, for dry storage of spent 
nuclear fuel in a specific MPC (i.e., MPC-89) at the LGS ISFSI.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The CoC is the NRC approved design for each dry cask storage 
system. The proposed action would exempt the applicant from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 only as these requirements pertain to the use 
of the MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System for the three 
already loaded systems and the near-term planned loading of five new 
canisters. The exemption would allow Constellation to maintain loaded 
and to load five new MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System 
at the LGS ISFSI, despite the MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System not being in compliance with the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1.
    The HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC provides the requirements,

[[Page 38922]]

conditions, and operating limits necessary for use of the system to 
store spent fuel. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and 
manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, developed a variant 
of the design with CBS for the MPC-89, known as MPC-89-CBS. Holtec 
originally implemented the CBS variant design under the provisions of 
10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, tests, and experiments,'' which allows 
licensees to make changes to cask designs without a CoC amendment under 
certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After evaluating the 
specific changes to the cask designs, the NRC determined that Holtec 
erred when it implemented the CBS variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as 
this was not the type of change allowed without a CoC amendment. For 
this reason, the NRC issued three Severity Level IV violations to 
Holtec. Prior to the issuance of the violations, Constellation had 
already loaded three MPC-89-CBS in a HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, 
which are safely in storage on the LGS ISFSI pad. Additionally, 
Constellation plans to load five new MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System beginning in August 2024. This exemption considers the 
storage of the already loaded systems and the near-term planned loading 
of the five canisters with the CBS variant basket design.

Need for the Proposed Action

    Constellation requested this exemption because Constellation is 
currently out of compliance with NRC requirements, resulting from the 
previous loading of spent fuel into a storage system with the CBS 
variant basket design. This exemption would allow three already loaded 
MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System to remain in storage 
at the LGS ISFSI. The applicant also requested the exemption in order 
to allow the LGS to load five new MPC-89-CBS in HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System at the LGS ISFSI for the future loading campaign beginning in 
August 2024.
    Approval of the exemption request would allow Constellation to 
effectively manage the spent fuel pool margin and capacity to enable 
refueling and offloading fuel from the reactor. It would also allow 
Constellation to effectively manage the availability of the specialized 
workforce and equipment needed to support competing fuel loading and 
operational activities at the LGS and other Constellation sites.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    This EA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting 
an exemption from the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1. The exemption would allow three 
loaded MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System to remain 
loaded at the LGS ISFSI. The exemption also would allow a near-term 
loading of five new MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System 
and allow the MPC-89-CBS to be maintained in storage at the LGS ISFSI.
    The potential environmental impacts of storing spent nuclear fuel 
in NRC-approved storage systems have been documented in previous 
assessments. On July 18, 1990, the NRC amended 10 CFR part 72 to 
provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general license in cask 
designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final rule analyzed 
the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved storage 
casks. The EA for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, published in 2015, tiers off of the EA 
issued for the July 18, 1990, final rule. ``Tiering'' off earlier EAs 
is a standard process encouraged by the regulations implementing the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) that entails the use 
of impact analyses of previous EAs to bound the impacts of a proposed 
action where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System is 
designed to mitigate the effects of design basis accidents that could 
occur during storage. Considering the specific design requirements for 
the accident conditions, the design of the cask would prevent loss of 
containment, shielding, and criticality control. If there is no loss of 
containment, shielding, or criticality control, the environmental 
impacts would not be significant.
    The exemptions requested by Constellation at the LGS site as they 
relate to CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, for the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System are limited to the use of the CBS variant 
basket design only for the already loaded three canisters and near-term 
planned loading of five canisters utilizing the CBS variant basket 
design. The staff has determined that this change in the basket will 
not result in either radiological or non-radiological environmental 
impacts that significantly differ from the environmental impacts 
evaluated in the environmental assessment supporting the issuance of 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1. If the exemption is 
granted, there will be no significant change in the types or amounts of 
any effluents released, no significant increase in individual or 
cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure, and no 
significant increase in the potential for or consequences from 
radiological accidents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that 
there would be no significant environmental impacts associated with the 
proposed action.

Alternative to the Proposed Action

    The staff considered the no-action alternative. The no-action 
alternative (denial of the exemption request) would require 
Constellation to unload spent fuel from the MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM 
FW MPC Storage System to bring it in compliance with the CoC terms, 
conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, 
Revision No. 1. Unloading the cask would subject station personnel to 
additional radiation exposure, generate additional contaminated waste, 
increase the risk of a possible fuel handling accident, and increase 
the risk of a possible heavy load handling accident. Furthermore, the 
removed spent fuel would need to be placed in the spent fuel pool, 
where it would remain until it could be loaded into an approved storage 
cask. Delay in the loading of this spent fuel into other casks could 
affect Constellation's ability to effectively manage the spent fuel 
pool capacity and reactor fuel offloading. Not allowing the planned 
future loading campaign could also affect Constellation's ability to 
manage pool capacity, reactor fuel offloading, and refueling. It could 
also pose challenges to spent fuel heat removal and impact the 
availability of the specialized workforce and equipment needed to 
support competing fuel loading and operational activities at the LGS 
and other Constellation sites. The NRC has determined that the no-
action alternative would result in undue potential human health and 
safety impacts that could be avoided by proceeding with the proposed 
exemption, especially given that the staff has concluded in NRC's 
Safety Determination Memorandum, issued with respect to the enforcement 
action against Holtec regarding these violations, that fuel can be 
stored safely in the MPC-89-CBS canisters.

Agencies Consulted

    The NRC provided the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental 
Protection (PDEP) a copy of this draft EA for review by an email dated 
April 29, 2024. On May 1, 2024, PDEP provided its concurrence by email.

[[Page 38923]]

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action have been reviewed 
in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement 
NEPA. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the NRC finds 
that the proposed action of granting the exemption from the regulations 
in 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11) 
and 72.214, which require the licensee to comply with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of the CoC, in this case limited to past 
and specific future loadings of baskets with the CBS variant design, 
would not significantly impact the quality of the human environment. 
Accordingly, the NRC has determined that a FONSI is appropriate, and an 
environmental impact statement is not warranted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is reviewing an exemption request from Energy Harbor 
Nuclear Corporation, dated February 27, 2024, and supplemented by 
VistraOps on March 22, 2024. VistraOps is requesting an exemption, 
pursuant to section 72.7 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(10 CFR), in paragraphs 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require VistraOps to comply with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1032, Amendment 
No. 5. If approved, the exemption would allow VistraOps to load two 
MPCs which contain the 89-assembly CBS basket (MPC-89-CBS) beginning in 
August 2024 in the HI-STORM FW Storage System at the Perry ISFSI in a 
storage condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in 
the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5 are not met.

II. Environmental Assessment

Background

    Perry is located on a 1,100 acre site on Lake Erie, 40 miles 
northeast of Cleveland in North Perry, Ohio. Unit 1 began operating in 
1987. VistraOps has been storing spent fuel in an ISFSI at Perry under 
a general license as authorized by 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' VistraOps

[[Page 38927]]

currently uses the HI-STORM FW Storage System under CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 5 for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a specific MPC 
(i.e., MPC-89) at the Perry ISFSI.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The CoC is the NRC approved design for each dry cask storage 
system. The proposed action would exempt the applicant from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 only as these requirements pertain to the use 
of the MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW Storage System for near-term 
planned cask loadings. The exemption would allow VistraOps to load two 
MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW Storage System at the Perry ISFSI, 
despite the MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW Storage System not being in 
compliance with the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC 
No. 1032, Amendment No. 5.
    The CoC for the HI-STORM FW Storage System provides the 
requirements, conditions, and operating limits necessary for use of the 
system to store spent fuel. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer 
and manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW Storage System, developed a variant 
of the design with CBS for the MPC-89, known as MPC-89-CBS. Holtec 
originally implemented the CBS variant design under the provisions of 
10 CFR 72.48, which allows licensees to make changes to cask designs 
without a CoC amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 
72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, 
the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS 
variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this was not the type of change 
allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three 
Severity Level IV violations to Holtec. Perry plans to load two MPC-89-
CBS canisters in the HI-STORM FW overpacks beginning in August 2024. 
This exemption considers the near-term planned loading of the two 
canisters with the CBS variant basket design.

Need for the Proposed Action

    VistraOps requested this exemption in order to allow loading of two 
MPC-89-CBS in HI-STORM FW Storage System at the Perry ISFSI for the 
future loading campaign scheduled in August 2024.
    Approval of the exemption request would allow VistraOps to 
effectively manage the spent fuel pool margin and capacity to maintain 
full core offload capability until its next storage cask loading 
campaign in 2028. Otherwise, after the refueling outages in 2025 and 
2027, Perry would have an insufficient number of open fuel cells (a 
deficit of 25 open cells) in the spent fuel pool. It would also allow 
VistraOps to effectively manage the availability of the specialized 
workforce and equipment needed to support competing fuel loading and 
operational activities at the Perry ISFSI.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    This EA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting 
an exemption from the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 5. The exemption would allow two MPC-89-CBS 
canisters to be loaded in the HI-STORM FW Storage System in the near-
term loading campaign scheduled for August 2024.
    The potential environmental impacts of storing spent nuclear fuel 
in NRC-approved storage systems have been documented in previous 
assessments. On July 18, 1990, the NRC amended 10 CFR part 72 to 
provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general license in cask 
designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final rule analyzed 
the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved storage 
casks. The EA for the HI-STORM FW Storage System, CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 5, published in 2020, tiers off of the EA issued for the 
July 18, 1990, final rule. ``Tiering'' off earlier EAs is a standard 
process encouraged by the regulations implementing the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) that entails the use of impact 
analyses of previous EAs to bound the impacts of a proposed action 
where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM FW Storage System is designed to 
mitigate the effects of design basis accidents that could occur during 
storage. Considering the specific design requirements for the accident 
conditions, the design of the cask would prevent loss of containment, 
shielding, and criticality control. If there is no loss of containment, 
shielding, or criticality control, the environmental impacts would not 
be significant.
    The exemptions requested by VistraOps at the Perry site as they 
relate to CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5 for the HI-STORM FW Storage 
System are limited to the near-term planned loading of two storage 
systems utilizing the CBS variant basket design. The staff determined 
that this change in the basket would not result in either radiological 
or non-radiological environmental impacts that significantly differ 
from the environmental impacts evaluated in the environmental 
assessment supporting the issuance of CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5. If 
the exemption is granted, there would be no significant change in the 
types or amounts of any effluents released, no significant increase in 
individual or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure, and 
no significant increase in the potential for or consequences from 
radiological accidents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that 
there would be no significant environmental impacts associated with the 
proposed action.

Alternative to the Proposed Action

    The staff considered the no-action alternative. The no-action 
alternative (denial of the exemption request) would require VistraOps 
to delay the near-term planned loading of spent fuel in the MPC-89-CBS 
in the HI-STORM FW Storage System at the Perry ISFSI. Delaying the 
loading of spent fuel into the two casks in August 2024 could affect 
VistraOps's ability to effectively manage pool capacity, reactor fuel 
offloading, and refueling. It could also pose challenges to spent fuel 
heat removal and impact the availability of the specialized workforce 
and equipment needed to support competing fuel loading and operational 
activities at Perry and other VistraOps sites. The NRC determined that 
the no-action alternative would result in undue potential human health 
and safety impacts that could be avoided by proceeding with the 
proposed exemption, especially given that the staff has concluded in 
NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum, issued with respect to the 
enforcement action against Holtec regarding these violations, that fuel 
can be stored safely in the MPC-89-CBS casks.

Agencies Consulted

    The NRC provided the Ohio Emergency Management Agency (OH-EMA) a 
copy of this draft EA for review by an email dated April 25, 2024. On 
April 25, 2024, OH-EMA stated via email that it had no comments on the 
draft EA and FONSI.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action have been reviewed 
in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement 
NEPA. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the NRC finds 
that the proposed action of granting the exemption from the regulations 
in 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11) 
and 72.214, which require the licensee to comply with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of the CoC, in this case limited to 
specific future loading of two

[[Page 38928]]

canisters with the 89-assembly CBS variant design basket beginning 
August 2024, would not significantly impact the quality of the human 
environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined that a FONSI is 
appropriate, and an environmental impact statement is not warranted.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Docket Nos. 72-53, 50-254, and 50-265

Constellation Energy Generation, LLC; Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station 
Units 1 and 2; Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation) is the holder 
of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-29 and DPR-30, which 
authorize operation of the Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 
and 2 (QCNPS) in Cordova, Illinois, pursuant to Part 50 of Title 10 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities.'' The licenses provide, among 
other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, 
and orders of

[[Page 38924]]

the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now or hereafter in 
effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. Constellation is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors 
under 10 CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for 
storage of spent fuel at the QCNPS ISFSI. Under the terms of the 
general license, Constellation stores spent fuel at its QCNPS ISFSI 
using the HI-STORM 100 Cask System in accordance with Certificate of 
Compliance (CoC) No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated March 15, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System [ADAMS] Accession No. ML24075A001), Constellation 
requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 
72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require 
QCNPS to comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the 
CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1 (ML16041A233). If 
approved, Constellation's exemption request would accordingly allow 
QCNPS to load four Multi-Purpose Canisters (MPC) with an unapproved 
variant basket design with continuous basket shims (CBS) (i.e., MPC-
68M-CBS) in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System, beginning June 2024, and 
thus, to load the systems in a storage condition where the terms, 
conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, 
Revision No. 1 are not met.
    Constellation currently uses the HI-STORM 100 Cask System under CoC 
No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, for dry storage of spent 
nuclear fuel in MPC-68M at the QCNPS ISFSI. Holtec International 
(Holtec), the designer and manufacturer of the HI-STORM 100 Cask 
System, developed a variant of the design with CBS for the MPC-68M, 
known as MPC-68M-CBS. Holtec performed a non-mechanistic tip-over 
analysis with favorable results and implemented the CBS variant design 
under the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, tests, and 
experiments,'' which allows licensees to make changes to cask designs 
without a CoC amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 
72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, 
the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS 
variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this is not the type of change 
allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three 
Severity Level IV violations to Holtec (ML24016A190).
    Constellation's near-term loading campaign for the QCNPS ISFSI 
includes loading four MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System 
beginning in June 2024. While Holtec was required to submit a CoC 
amendment to the NRC to seek approval of the CBS variant design, such a 
process will not be completed in time to inform decisions for this 
near-term loading campaign. Therefore, Constellation submitted this 
exemption request to allow for the future loading of four new MPC-68M-
CBS beginning in June 2024, at the QCNPS ISFSI. This exemption is 
limited to the use of four MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System 
for the specific near-term planned loading beginning June 2024.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow Constellation to load four MPC-68M-CBS 
in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System beginning June 2024 at its QCNPS ISFSI 
in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications 
in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, are not met. 
Constellation is requesting an exemption from the provisions in 10 CFR 
part 72 that require the licensee to comply with the terms, conditions, 
and specifications of the CoC for the approved cask model it uses. 
Section 72.7 allows the NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements 
of 10 CFR part 72. This authority to grant exemptions is consistent 
with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and is not otherwise 
inconsistent with NRC's regulations or other applicable laws. 
Additionally, no other law prohibits the activities that would be 
authorized by the exemption. Therefore, the NRC concludes that there is 
no statutory prohibition on the issuance of the requested exemption, 
and the NRC is authorized to grant the exemption by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    This exemption would allow Constellation to load four MPC-68M-CBS 
in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System beginning June 2024 at the QCNPS ISFSI 
in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications 
in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, are not met. In 
support of its exemption request, Constellation asserts that issuance 
of the exemption would not endanger life or property because the 
administrative controls the applicant has in place prevent a tip-over 
or handling event and that the containment boundary would be maintained 
in such an event. Constellation relies, in part, on the approach in the 
NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum (ML24018A085). The NRC issued 
this Safety Determination Memorandum to address whether, with respect 
to the enforcement action against Holtec regarding this violation, 
there was any need to take an immediate action for the cask systems 
that were already loaded with non-compliant basket designs. The Safety 
Determination Memorandum documents a risk-informed approach concluding 
that, during the design basis event of a non-mechanistic tip-over, the 
fuel in the basket in the MPC-68M-CBS remains in a subcritical 
condition.
    Constellation also provided site-specific technical information, 
including information explaining why the use of the approach in the 
NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum is appropriate for determining 
the safe use of the CBS variant baskets at the QCNPS ISFSI. 
Specifically, Constellation described that the analysis of the tip-over 
design basis event that is relied upon in the NRC's Safety 
Determination Memorandum, which demonstrates that the MPC confinement 
barrier is maintained, is documented in the updated final safety 
analysis report (UFSAR) for the HI-STORM 100 Cask System CoC No. 1014, 
Amendment 8, Revision No. 1, that is used at the QCNPS site. 
Constellation also described its administrative controls for handling 
of the HI-STORM 100 Cask System at the QCNPS ISFSI to prevent a tip-
over or handling event. Those controls include operational procedures 
that demonstrate that the system is handled with a single failure proof 
device, designed in accordance with ANSI N14.6, ``Radioactive 
Materials--Special Lifting Devices for Shipping Containers Weighing 10 
000 Pounds

[[Page 38925]]

(4500 kg) or More,'' for heavy load lifting component, inside of the 
Reactor Buildings and during transport to the ISFSI. In addition, the 
transporter employs redundant drop features.
    Additionally, Constellation provided specific information from 
QCNPS's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 17, indicating that during 
the design basis event of a non-mechanistic tip-over, QCNPS's ISFSI 
would meet the requirements in 10 CFR 72.104, ``Criteria for 
radioactive materials in effluents and direct radiation from an ISFSI 
or MRS,'' and 72.106, ``Controlled area of an ISFSI or MRS.'' 
Specifically, Constellation described that, in the highly unlikely 
event of a tip-over, any potential fuel damage from a non-mechanistic 
tip-over event would be localized, the confinement barrier would be 
maintained, and the shielding material would remain intact. Coupled 
with the distance of the QCNPS ISFSI to the site area boundary, 
Constellation concluded that compliance with 72.104 and 72.106 is not 
impacted by approving this exemption request.
    The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by Constellation 
and concludes that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or 
property because the administrative controls that Constellation has in 
place at the QCNPS ISFSI sufficiently minimize the possibility of a 
tip-over or handling event, and that the containment boundary would be 
maintained in such an event. The staff confirmed that these 
administrative controls comply with the technical specifications and 
UFSAR for the HI-STORM 100 Cask System CoC No. 1014, Amendment 8, 
Revision No. 1, that is used at the QCNPS site. In addition, the staff 
confirmed that the information provided by Constellation regarding the 
QCNPS's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 17, demonstrates that the 
consequences of normal and accident conditions would be within the 
regulatory limits of the 10 CFR 72.104 and 10 CFR 72.106. The staff 
also determined that the requested exemption is not related to any 
aspect of the physical security or defense of the QCNPS ISFSI; 
therefore, granting the exemption would not result in any potential 
impacts to common defense and security.
    For these reasons, the NRC staff has determined that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow Constellation to load four MPC-
68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System beginning in June 2024 at the 
QCNPS ISFSI, even though the CBS variant basket design is not part of 
the approved CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1. According 
to Constellation, the exemption is in the public interest because the 
inability to load fuel into dry storage in the future loading campaign 
would impact Constellation's ability to offload fuel from the QCNPS 
reactor units, consequently impacting continued safe reactor operation.
    Constellation stated that delaying the future loading campaign 
would impact its ability to effectively manage the margin to full core 
discharge capacity in the QCNPS Unit 1 and Unit 2 spent fuel pools. The 
low spent fuel pool capacity would make it difficult to refuel and 
present potential risks to fuel handling operations during pre- and 
post-outage. In addition, a crowded spent fuel pool would challenge the 
decay heat removal demand of the pool and, therefore, increase the 
consequence of a loss of fuel pool cooling event. The additional fuel 
moves that would be required to manage the fuel pool loading with extra 
bundles in the pool would also increase the likelihood of a fuel 
handling accident. Furthermore, QCNPS planned the cask loading campaign 
years in advance based on availability of the specialized workforce and 
equipment that is shared throughout the Constellation fleet. These 
specialty resources support competing priorities including refueling 
outages, loading campaigns, fuel pool cleanouts, fuel inspections, fuel 
handing equipment upgrade and maintenance, fuel sipping, new fuel 
receipt, and crane maintenance and upgrades. Any delays would have a 
cascading impact on other scheduled specialized activities.
    For the reasons described by Constellation in the exemption 
request, the NRC agrees that it is in the public interest to grant the 
exemption. If the exemption is not granted, to comply with the CoC, 
Constellation would have to delay future loading and keep the spent 
nuclear fuel in the spent fuel pool. As described by Constellation, 
this scenario would affect Constellation's ability to effectively 
manage the spent pool capacity and reactor fuel offloading at QCNPS. In 
addition, a crowded spent fuel pool would challenge the decay heat 
removal demand of the pool increasing the consequence of a loss of fuel 
pool cooling event; and, because additional fuel moves would be 
required, it would also increase the likelihood of a fuel handling 
accident. Moreover, the rescheduling of the specialized resources for 
the future loading campaign would impact the operations of QCNPS and 
other Constellation sites.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite, and there would be no significant increase in occupational or 
public radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The 
environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact was 
published on April 30, 2024 (89 FR 34282).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants 
Constellation an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  
72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 
with respect to the future loading in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System of 
four MPC-68M-CBS beginning in June 2024.

    This exemption is effective upon issuance.
    Dated: April 30, 2024.

disclosure)
    10. Abstract: The NRC regulations in 10 CFR part 26 prescribe 
requirements to establish, implement, and maintain FFD programs at 
affected licensees and other entities. The objectives of these 
requirements are to provide reasonable assurance that persons subject 
to the rule are trustworthy, reliable, and not under the influence of 
any substance, legal or illegal, or mentally or physically impaired 
from any cause, which in any way could adversely affect their ability 
to safely and competently perform their duties. These requirements also 
provide reasonable assurance that the effects of fatigue and degraded 
alertness on individual's abilities to safely and competently perform 
their duties are managed commensurate with maintaining public health 
and safety. The information collections required by 10 CFR part 26 are 
necessary to properly manage FFD programs and to enable effective and 
efficient regulatory oversight of affected licensees and other 
entities. These licensees and other entities must perform certain 
tasks, maintain records, and submit reports to comply with 10 CFR part 
26 drug and alcohol and fatigue management

[[Page 38197]]

requirements. These records and reports are necessary to enable 
regulatory inspection and evaluation of a licensee's or other entity's 
compliance with NRC regulations, FFD performance, and significant FFD-
related events to help maintain public health and safety, promote the 
common defense and security, and protect the environment.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2024-0070]


Application for Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses and 
Involving Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination 
and Containing Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information and 
Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: License amendment request; notice of opportunity to comment, 
request a hearing, and petition for leave to intervene; order imposing 
procedures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is 
considering approval of one amendment request. The amendment request is 
for Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2. For the amendment 
request, the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant 
hazards consideration (NSHC). Because the amendment request contains 
sensitive unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an order 
imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention preparation 
by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave to 
intervene.

DATES: Comments must be filed by June 6, 2024. A request for a hearing 
or petitions for leave to intervene must be filed by July 8, 2024. Any 
potential party as defined in section 2.4 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) who believes access to SUNSI is necessary 
to respond to this notice must request document access by May 17, 2024.

II. Background

    Pursuant to Section 189a.(1)-(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), the NRC is publishing this notice. The Act 
requires the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued or 
proposed to be issued and grants the Commission the authority to issue 
and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or 
combined license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission 
that such amendment involves NSHC, notwithstanding the pendency before 
the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.
    This notice includes a notice of an amendment containing SUNSI.

III. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of an Amendment to Facility 
Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration 
Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing

    The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following 
amendment request involves NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 
10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance 
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this 
proposed determination for the amendment request is shown as follows.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed 
determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue the license amendment before expiration of the 60-
day period provided that its final determination is that the amendment 
involves no significant hazards consideration. In addition, the 
Commission may issue the amendment prior to the expiration of the 30-
day comment period if circumstances change during the 30-day comment 
period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for 
example, in derating or shutdown of the facility. If the Commission 
takes action on the amendment prior to the expiration of either the 
comment period or the notice period, it will publish a notice of 
issuance in the Federal Register. If the Commission makes a final no 
significant hazards consideration determination for the amendment, any 
hearing on the amendment will take place after issuance. The Commission 
expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    The following table provides the plant name, docket numbers, date 
of application, ADAMS accession number, and location in the application 
of the licensee's proposed NSHC determination. For further details with 
respect to this license amendment application, see the application for 
amendment, publicly available portions of which are available for

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information for Contention Preparation

Constellation Energy Generating, LLC

Limerick Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, Montgomery County, PA

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI).
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of hearing or 
opportunity for hearing, any potential party who believes access to 
SUNSI is necessary to respond to this notice may request access to 
SUNSI. A ``potential party'' is any person who intends to participate 
as a party by demonstrating standing and filing an admissible 
contention under 10 CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI submitted 
later than 10 days after publication of this notice will not be 
considered absent a showing of good cause for the late filing, 
addressing why the request could not have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemakings and 
Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy General Counsel 
for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the General 
Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001. 
The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both offices is: 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, 
Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the Secretary and 
the Office of the General Counsel are [email protected] and 
[email protected], respectively.\1\ The request must 
include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI under these 
procedures should be submitted as described in this paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice;
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1); and
    (3) The identity of the individual or entity requesting access to 
SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the need for the information in 
order to meaningfully participate in this adjudicatory proceeding. In 
particular, the request must explain why publicly available versions of 
the information requested would not be sufficient to provide the basis 
and specificity for a proffered contention.
    D. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraph C, the NRC staff will determine within 10 days of receipt of 
the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI.
    E. If the NRC staff determines that the requestor satisfies both 
D.(1) and D.(2), the NRC staff will notify the requestor in writing 
that access to SUNSI has been granted. The written notification will 
contain instructions on how the requestor may obtain copies of the 
requested documents, and any other conditions that may apply to access 
to those documents. These conditions may include, but are not limited 
to, the signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or 
Protective Order \2\ setting forth terms and conditions to prevent the 
unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of SUNSI by each individual who 
will be granted access to SUNSI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    F. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 days after 
receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more than 25 
days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) the 
information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing), the 
petitioner may file its SUNSI contentions by that later deadline.
    G. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI is denied by the NRC staff 
after a determination on standing and requisite need, the NRC staff 
shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly stating the 
reason or reasons for the denial.
    (2) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination by filing a challenge within 5 days of receipt of that 
determination with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    (3) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    H. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest

[[Page 38194]]

independent of the proceeding. Such a challenge must be filed within 5 
days of the notification by the NRC staff of its grant of access and 
must be filed with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or denying access) is governed by 10 
CFR 2.311.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562; August 3, 2012, 78 FR 34247, June 7, 2013) apply to 
appeals of NRC staff determinations (because they must be served on 
a presiding officer or the Commission, as applicable), but not to 
the initial SUNSI request submitted to the NRC staff under these 
procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests 
for access to SUNSI, and motions for protective orders, in a timely 
fashion in order to minimize any unnecessary delays in identifying 
those petitioners who have standing and who have propounded contentions 
meeting the specificity and basis requirements in 10 CFR part 2. The 
attachment to this Order summarizes the general target schedule for 
processing and resolving requests under these procedures.
    It is so ordered.

    Dated: April 15, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

                                     whether the request for access
                                     provides a reasonable basis to
                                     believe standing can be established
                                     and shows need for SUNSI. (NRC

                                     information.) If NRC staff makes
                                     the finding of need for SUNSI and
                                     likelihood of standing, NRC staff

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 50-29 and 72-31; NRC-2024-0067]


Yankee Atomic Electric Company; Yankee Atomic Power Station; 
Exemption

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued an 
exemption in response to the May 4, 2023, request from Yankee Atomic 
Electric Company (YAEC), for the Yankee Nuclear Power Station (YNPS or 
Yankee Rowe) located in Rowe, Massachusetts. The exemption permits YAEC 
to make withdrawals from a separate account within YAEC's overall 
nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT), on an annual basis, for spent 
nuclear fuel (SNF) and Greater than Class C

[[Page 38195]]

(GTCC) waste management and non-radiological site restoration without 
prior notification to the NRC.

DATE: The exemption was issued on April 11, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tilda Liu, Office of Nuclear Material 
Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, 
DC 20555-0001; telephone: 404-997-4730, email: [email protected].

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By letter dated May 4, 2023 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML23157A101), YAEC submitted a request to the NRC for an exemption 
from paragraphs 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) for the YNPS Independent Spent 
Fuel Storage Installation \1\ (ISFSI).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As discussed in this document, the Yankee Rowe ISFSI sits on 
the former site of Yankee Rowe, which YAEC finished decommissioning 
in 2007. Although only the Yankee Rowe ISFSI remains on the site, 
YAEC's 10 CFR part 50 license, Facility Operating License No. DPR-3, 
remains in effect. Because YAEC requested an exemption from the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 50, this would be an exemption for 
YAEC's 10 CFR part 50 license rather than for YAEC's 10 CFR part 72 
general license. Therefore, although YAEC's submission requested an 
exemption for the Yankee Rowe ISFSI, the NRC staff will consider it 
a request for an exemption for YNPS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    YAEC has established a separate (segregated) account within its 
over-arching NDT, entitled ``ISFSI Radiological Decom,'' that 
identifies the funds for radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI 
apart from the larger balance of funds in the NDT allocated for ongoing 
management of SNF and GTCC waste and for non-radiological site 
restoration activities. Although 10 CFR 50.82 applies to the segregated 
account, it does not apply to the overall NDT.
    The exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) allows 
YAEC to make withdrawals from the segregated account, on an annual 
basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site 
restoration without prior notification to the NRC. More specifically, 
with this exemption, YAEC can annually transfer funds exceeding 110 
percent of the inflation-adjusted Decommissioning Cost Estimate, 
described in 10 CFR 50.75, from the segregated account to its 
overarching NDT and use those funds for SNF and GTCC waste management 
and non-radiological site restoration.
    Based on the review, the NRC determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue 
risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common 
defense and security. Also, the NRC determined that special 
circumstances are present. Therefore, the NRC granted YAEC an exemption 
from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(2) to permit YAEC to make withdrawals from the segregated 
account, on an annual basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-
radiological site restoration without prior notification to the NRC. 
All other relevant requirements shall be met. On April 11, 2024, the 
NRC issued an exemption for YAEC (ADAMS Package Accession No. 
ML23298A052). The NRC staff also prepared an environmental assessment 
and finding of no significant impact regarding the proposed exemption 
request, published in the Federal Register on April 9, 2024 (89 FR 
24877), and concluded that the proposed exemption would not have a 
significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

    Dated: May 2, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Yoira Diaz-Sanabria,
Chief, Storage and Transportation Licensing Branch, Division of Fuel 
Management, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.

want to be publicly disclosed in your comment submission. All comment 
submissions are posted at https://www.regulations.gov and entered into 
ADAMS. Comment submissions are not routinely edited to remove 
identifying or contact information.
    If you are requesting or aggregating comments from other persons 
for submission to the NRC, then you should inform those persons not to 
include identifying or contact information that they do not want to be

information before making the comment submissions available to the 
public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Background

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
chapter 35), the NRC is requesting public comment on its intention to 
request the OMB's approval for the information collection summarized as 
follows.
    1. The title of the information collection: Public Records and NRC 
Forms 507 and 509.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0043.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: NRC Forms 507 and 509.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: On occasion.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Freedom of Information 
Act (FOIA) requesters, outside vendors, and licensees who submit an 
objection to disclosure.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 628.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 273.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 180.5.
    10. Abstract: The FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552, and the implementing 
regulations, part 9 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR), ``Public Records,'' require individuals seeking access to records 
under the FOIA and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, to 
submit a request in writing and to describe the records sought 
sufficiently for the NRC to conduct a reasonable search. The Privacy 
Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, establishes a code of fair 
information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, 
and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained 
in systems of records by Federal agencies. Specifically, Subpart B 
(Privacy Act regulations) implements the provisions of the Privacy Act 
of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), with respect to the procedures by 
which individuals may determine the existence of, seek access to, and 
request correction of NRC records concerning themselves. Requesters can 
currently submit FOIA and/or Privacy Act requests in writing, fax, 
email, https://www.foia.gov or by using the Public Access Link (https://foia.nrc-gateway.gov/app/Home.aspx). NRC Form 509, ``Statement of 
Estimated Fees for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request'' is used 
by: (1) the NRC to notify requesters that fees will be assessed for 
processing their FOIA requests, (2) the requester to notify NRC in 
writing of their agreement to pay fees, (3) the NRC to notify the 
requester to submit a written request for a waiver pursuant to 10 CFR 
9.41 within 10 working days from the receipt of the notice, and (4) the 
NRC to notify the requester to provide advanced payment of estimated 
fees. NRC Form 507, ``Identity Verification and/or Third-Party 
Authorization for Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act Requests,'' is 
used by requesters to provide the identity verification or third-party 
authorization that is needed by the NRC in order to process their 
requests. The NRC uses the information provided by requesters to 
process requests from the public. In addition, outside vendors and 
licensees can submit an objection to disclosure. The NRC needs this 
information to properly process FOIA requests that involve confidential 
information or trade secrets.

III. Specific Requests for Comments

    The NRC is seeking comments that address the following questions:
    1. Is the proposed collection of information necessary for the NRC 
to properly perform its functions? Does the information have practical 
utility? Please explain your answer.
    2. Is the estimate of the burden of the information collection 
accurate? Please explain your answer.
    3. Is there a way to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected?
    4. How can the burden of the information collection on respondents 
be minimized, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act 
of 1974, as amended (Pub. L. 93-438), defines an ``abnormal 
occurrence'' as an unscheduled incident or event that the NRC 
determines to be significant from the standpoint of public health or 
safety. The FY 2023 AO report, NUREG-0090, Volume 46, ``Report to 
Congress on Abnormal Occurrences: Fiscal Year 2023'' describes those 
events that the NRC identified as AOs during FY 2023.
    This report describes nine events involving Agreement State 
licensees and two events involving NRC licensees. Seven of the AOs 
occurred at medical facilities, three AOs involved the theft or 
diversion and recovery of Category 2 radioactive material sources, and 
the other event involved an overexposure.
    The NRC identified no events at NRC-licensed facilities during FY 
2023 that met the guidelines for inclusion in Appendix B, ``Other 
Events of Interest.''
    One event met the guidelines for inclusion in Appendix C, ``Updates 
of Previously Reported Abnormal Occurrences.''
    Agreement States are the 39 U.S. States that currently have entered 
into formal agreements with the NRC pursuant to section 274 of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA), to regulate certain 
quantities of AEA-licensed material at facilities located within their 
borders.
    The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 
104-68) requires that AOs be reported to Congress annually. The full 
report, NUREG-0090, Volume 46, ``Report to Congress on Abnormal

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    In accordance with section 51.118 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Final environmental impact statement--
notice of availability,'' the NRC is making available final Supplement 
60, License Renewal to NUREG-1437, regarding the renewal of Vistra 
Operations Company LLC; Luminant (Vistra), operating licenses NPF-87 
and NPF-89 for an additional 20 years of operation for CPNPP. A Notice 
of Availability of draft Supplement 60, License Renewal to NUREG-1437 
was published in the Federal Register on November 9, 2023 (88 FR 
77308), by the Environmental Protection Agency. The public comment 
period on draft Supplement 60, License Renewal to NUREG-1437 ended on 
December 26, 2023, and the comments received are addressed in final 
Supplement 60, License Renewal to NUREG-1437.

II. Discussion

    As discussed in Chapter 4 of final Supplement 60, License Renewal 
to NUREG-1437, the NRC staff determined that the adverse environmental 
impacts of subsequent license renewal for CPNPP are not so great that 
preserving the option of subsequent license renewal for energy-planning 
decisionmakers would not be unreasonable. This recommendation is based 
on: (1) the analysis and findings in the GEIS; (2) information provided 
in the environmental report and other documents submitted by Vistra; 
(3) consultation with Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies; (4) 
the NRC staff's independent environmental review; and (5) consideration 
of public comments received during the scoping process and on the draft 
SEIS.

    Dated: April 26, 2024.

nuclear material, to maintain the VNC in a safe condition (including 
storage, control, and maintenance of all nuclear material), and to 
decommission the VNC to NorthStar Vallecitos. This license transfer 
application was submitted to the NRC for approval under Section 184, 
``Inalienability of Licenses,'' of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (AEA), and Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 
50.80, ``Transfer of licenses''; 10 CFR 50.90, ``Application for 
amendment of license, construction permit, or early site permit''; 10 
CFR 70.34, ``Amendment of licenses''; and 10 CFR 70.36, 
``Inalienability of licenses.'' Notice of the receipt of the license 
transfer application and opportunity to comment, request a hearing, and 
petition for leave to intervene was published in the Federal Register 
on November 8, 2023 (88 FR 77113). The supplemental letters, listed 
above, contained clarifying information and did not expand the license 
transfer application beyond the scope of the original notice.
    GEHA intends to transfer its licensed possession, maintenance, and 
decommissioning authorities to NorthStar Vallecitos to expedite the 
decommissioning at the VNC. Following approval and completion of the 
proposed direct transfer of control of the licenses, NorthStar 
Vallecitos would assume licensed responsibility for the VNC through the 
transfer of GEHA's responsibility for licensed activities at the VNC to 
NorthStar Vallecitos. NorthStar Vallecitos would own the VNC facility 
as well as its associated assets and real estate, including its 
decommissioning trust fund, title to spent nuclear fuel, and rights 
under the terms of its Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear 
Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste with the U.S. Department of 
Energy. Upon the proposed license transfer, NorthStar Vallecitos would 
assume responsibility for compliance with the current licensing basis, 
including regulatory commitments that exist at the closing of the 
transfer transaction between the Applicants, and would implement any 
changes under applicable regulatory requirements and practices. The 
Applicants also requested that the NRC impose license conditions 
relating to the management of the decommissioning trust fund, 
established for the purpose of providing decommissioning financial 
assurance for the licenses, and approve conforming administrative 
amendments to the licenses to reflect the direct transfer of the 
licenses from GEHA to NorthStar Vallecitos.
    The NRC received one public comment on the license transfer 
application. It is summarized in the NRC staff's safety evaluation of 
the license transfer application. The NRC staff reviewed the comment 
submission and considered it, as appropriate, as part of its evaluation 
of the application.
    Under 10 CFR 50.80, no license for a production or utilization 
facility, or any right thereunder, shall be transferred, either 
voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or indirectly, through transfer 
of control of the license to any person, unless the Commission gives 
its consent in writing. Under 10 CFR 70.36, no license to possess or 
use special nuclear material, or any right thereunder, shall be 
transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily, directly or 
indirectly, through transfer of control of the license to any person, 
unless the Commission gives its consent in writing. Upon review of the 
information in the license transfer application, as supplemented, and 
other information before the Commission, and relying upon the 
representations and agreements contained in the application, the NRC 
staff has determined that NorthStar Vallecitos is qualified to be the 
holder of the licenses, and that the direct transfer of the licenses, 
as described in the application, is otherwise consistent with 
applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued by the 
Commission pursuant thereto, subject to the condition set forth below.
    Upon review of the request in the license transfer application, as 
supplemented, for conforming administrative amendments to the licenses 
to reflect the direct transfer of the licenses, the NRC staff has 
determined the following:
    (1) The application for amendments complies with the standards and 
requirements of the AEA and the Commission's rules and regulations set 
forth in 10 CFR Chapter I.
    (2) There is reasonable assurance that the activities authorized by 
the amendments can be conducted without endangering the health and 
safety of the public and that such activities will be

[[Page 35864]]

conducted in compliance with the Commission's regulations.
    (3) The issuance of the amendments will not be inimical to the 
common defense and security or to the health and safety of the public.
    (4) The issuance of the amendments is in accordance with 10 CFR 
part 51, ``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing 
and Related Regulatory Functions,'' of the Commission's regulations, 
and all applicable requirements have been satisfied.
    The findings set forth above are supported by an NRC staff safety 
evaluation dated April 25 2024, which is available at ML24039A011.

III.

    Accordingly, under Sections 161b, 161i, 161o, and 184 of the AEA; 
42 U.S.C. 2201(b), 2201(i), 2201(o), and 2234; and 10 CFR 50.80, 10 CFR 
50.90, 10 CFR 70.34, and 10 CFR 70.36, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the 
application for the direct transfer of the licenses from GEHA to 
NorthStar Vallecitos, as described herein, is approved subject to the 
following condition:

Prior to the closing of the license transfer transaction, NorthStar 
Vallecitos, LLC shall provide the Director of the NRC's Office of 
Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS) satisfactory documentary 
evidence that it has obtained, or will have obtained upon the closing 
of the transaction, the appropriate amount of insurance under 10 CFR 
part 140 and 10 CFR 50.54(w), as applicable.

    It is further ordered that, consistent with 10 CFR 2.1315(b), the 
license amendments that make changes, as indicated in Enclosures 2 
through 7 to the letter transmitting this Order, to reflect the subject 
direct license transfer are approved. The amendments shall be issued 
and made effective at the time the license transfer transaction is 
completed.
    It is further ordered that NorthStar Vallecitos shall, at least 2 
business days before the planned closing of the license transfer 
transaction, inform the Director of NMSS in writing of the planned 
closing date. Should the proposed transfer not be completed within 1 
year of this Order's date of issuance, this Order shall become null and 
void; provided, however, that upon written application and for good 
cause shown, such date may be extended by order. The condition of this 
Order may be amended upon application by the Applicants and approval by 
the NRC.
    This Order is effective upon issuance.
    For further details with respect to this Order, see the license 
transfer application dated September 1, 2023, as supplemented on 
September 5, 2023; October 19, 2023; November 1, 2023; January 22,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    This BTP provides the NRC staff with guidance for evaluating an 
applicant's assessment of the adequacy of defense in depth and 
diversity (D3) for a proposed digital instrumentation and

[[Page 35252]]

control (DI&C) system. On October 24, 2023 (88 FR 73051), the NRC 
published for public comment a proposed revision to BTP 7-19, 
``Guidance for Evaluation of Defense in Depth and Diversity to Address 
Common-Cause Failure Due to Latent Design Defects in Digital 
Instrumentation and Control Systems'' of NUREG-0800, ``Standard Review 
Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power 
Plants: LWR Edition.'' The public comment period closed on November 24, 
2023. Thirty-five public comments were received regarding draft 
Revision 9 of BTP 7-19. The final Revision 9 to NUREG-0800, BTP 7-19, 
``Guidance for Evaluation of Defense in Depth and Diversity to Address 
Common-Cause Failure Due to Latent Design Defects in Digital 
Instrumentation and Control Systems'' is available in ADAMS under 
Accession No. ML24005A077.
    A summary of the public comments and the NRC staff's disposition of 
the comments are available in a separate document, ``Response to Public 
Comments on Draft Standard Review Plan Branch Technical Position 7-19, 
`Guidance for Evaluation of Defense in Depth and Diversity to Address 
Common-Cause Failure Due to Latent Design Defects in Digital 
Instrumentation and Control Systems' '' (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24005A115).

II. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Chapter 7 of the SRP provides guidance to the staff for reviewing 
instrumentation and controls information provided in applications for 
licensing actions. Part of Chapter 7 provides guidance for the 
evaluation of defense-in-depth and diversity in digital computer-based 
instrumentation and control systems. Issuance of this BTP revision does 
not constitute backfitting as defined in section 50.109 of title 10 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Backfitting'' (the Backfit 
Rule), and as described in Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management 
of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information 
Requests''; does not constitute forward fitting as that term is defined 
and described in MD 8.4; and does not affect the issue finality of any 
approval issued under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certificates, and 
Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants.'' The NRC staff's position is based 
upon the following considerations.
    First, the SRP provides guidance to the NRC staff on how to review 
an application for NRC regulatory approval in the form of licensing. 
Changes in internal guidance intended for use by only the staff are not 
matters that constitute backfitting as that term is defined in 10 CFR 
50.109(a)(1); does not constitute forward fitting as that term is 
defined and described in MD 8.4; and does not affect the issue finality 
of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certificates, 
and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants.''
    Second, the NRC staff does not intend to use the guidance in this 
SRP section to support NRC staff actions in a manner that would 
constitute backfitting or forward fitting. If, in the future, the NRC 
seeks to impose a position in this SRP section in a manner that 
constitutes backfitting, forward fitting, or affects the issue finality 
for a 10 CFR part 52 approval, then the NRC will address the Backfit 
Rule, the forward fitting provision of MD 8.4, or the applicable issue 
finality provision in 10 CFR part 52, respectively.

III. Congressional Review Act

    This standard review plan section is a rule as defined in the 
Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of 
Management and Budget has not found it to be a major rule as defined in 
the Congressional Review Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is reviewing an exemption request from Constellation, dated 
March 15, 2024. Constellation is requesting an exemption, pursuant to 
section 72.7 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
in paragraphs 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require Constellation to comply with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1014, Amendment 
No. 8, Revision No. 1. If approved, the exemption would allow 
Constellation to load four MPC-68M-CBS beginning June 2024 in the HI-
STORM 100 Cask System at the QCNPS ISFSI in a storage condition where 
the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1014, 
Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, are not met.

II. Environmental Assessment

Background

    QCNPS is located 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Quad 
Cities Metropolitan Area of Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa, and Rock 
Island, Moline and East Moline, Illinois. The site is on the east bank 
of Pool 14 of the Mississippi River, between Lock and Dams 13 and 14 
and approximately 810 kilometers (506 miles) upstream from its 
confluence with the Ohio River. Both Units 1 and 2 began operating in 
1973. Constellation has been storing spent fuel in an ISFSI at QCNPS 
under a general license as authorized by 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, 
``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' 
Constellation currently uses the HI-STORM 100 Cask System under CoC No. 
1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, for dry storage of spent nuclear 
fuel in a specific MPC (i.e., MPC-68M) at the QCNPS ISFSI.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The CoC is the NRC approved design for each dry cask storage 
system. The proposed action would exempt the applicant from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 only as these requirements pertain to the use 
of the MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System for the near-term 
planned loading of the systems. The exemption would allow Constellation 
to load four MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System at the QCNPS 
ISFSI beginning June 2024, despite the MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 
Cask System not being in compliance with the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1.
    The HI-STORM 100 Cask System CoC provides the requirements, 
conditions, and operating limits necessary for use of the system to 
store spent fuel. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and 
manufacturer of the HI-STORM 100 Cask System, developed a variant of 
the design with continuous basket shims (CBS) for the MPC-68M, known as 
MPC-68M-CBS. Holtec originally implemented the CBS variant design under 
the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48, which allows licensees to make changes 
to cask designs without a CoC amendment under certain conditions 
(listed in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to 
the cask designs, the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it 
implemented the CBS variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this was not 
the type of change allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, 
the NRC issued three Severity Level IV violations to Holtec. 
Constellation plans to load four MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask 
System beginning in June 2024. This exemption considers the near-term 
planned loading of the four canisters with the CBS variant basket 
design.

Need for the Proposed Action

    Constellation requested this exemption in order to allow QCNPS to 
load four MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System at the QCNPS

[[Page 34283]]

ISFSI for the future loading campaign scheduled to begin in June 2024. 
Approval of the exemption request would allow Constellation to 
effectively manage the spent fuel pool margin and capacity to enable 
refueling and offloading fuel from the reactor. It would also allow 
Constellation to effectively manage the availability of the specialized 
workforce and equipment needed to support competing fuel loading and 
operational activities at QCNPS and other Constellation sites.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    This EA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting 
an exemption from the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 
1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1. The exemption would allow four 
MPC-68M-CBS to be loaded in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System in the near-
term loading campaign and maintained in storage at the QCNPS ISFSI.
    The potential environmental impacts of storing spent nuclear fuel 
in NRC-approved storage systems have been documented in previous 
assessments. On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC amended 10 CFR 
part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general 
license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final 
rule analyzed the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved 
storage casks. The EA for the HI-STORM 100 Cask System, CoC No. 1014, 
Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1 (80 FR 49887), published in 2015, tiers 
off of the EA issued for the July 18, 1990, final rule. ``Tiering'' off 
earlier EAs is a standard process encouraged by the regulations 
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) that 
entails the use of impact analyses of previous EAs to bound the impacts 
of a proposed action where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM 100 Cask 
System is designed to mitigate the effects of design basis accidents 
that could occur during storage. Considering the specific design 
requirements for the accident conditions, the design of the cask would 
prevent loss of containment, shielding, and criticality control. If 
there is no loss of containment, shielding, or criticality control, the 
environmental impacts would not be significant.
    The exemptions requested by Constellation at the QCNPS site as they 
relate to CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, for the HI-
STORM 100 Cask System are limited to the use of the CBS variant basket 
design only for the near-term planned loading of four canisters 
utilizing the CBS variant basket design. The staff has determined that 
this change in the basket will not result in either radiological or 
non-radiological environmental impacts that significantly differ from 
the environmental impacts evaluated in the environmental assessment 
supporting the issuance of CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 
1. If the exemption is granted, there will be no significant change in 
the types or amounts of any effluents released, no significant increase 
in individual or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure, 
and no significant increase in the potential for or consequences from 
radiological accidents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that 
there would be no significant environmental impacts associated with the 
proposed action.

Alternative to the Proposed Action

    The staff considered the no-action alternative. The no-action 
alternative (denial of the exemption request) would require 
Constellation to delay the near-term planned future loading of four 
MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System. Not allowing the planned 
future loading campaign could affect Constellation's ability to manage 
pool capacity, reactor fuel offloading, and refueling. It could also 
pose challenges to spent fuel heat removal and impact the availability 
of the specialized workforce and equipment needed to support competing 
fuel loading and operational activities at QCNPS and other 
Constellation sites. The NRC has determined that the no-action 
alternative would result in undue potential human health and safety 
impacts that could be avoided by proceeding with the proposed 
exemption, especially given that the staff has concluded in the NRC's 
Safety Determination Memorandum, issued with respect to the enforcement 
action against Holtec regarding these violations, that fuel can be 
stored safely in the MPC-68M-CBS canisters.

Agencies Consulted

    The NRC provided the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and 
Office of Homeland Security (IL-IEMA-OHS) a copy of this draft EA for 
review by an email dated April 15, 2024. On April 23, 2024, the IL-
IEMA-OHS provided its concurrence by email.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action have been reviewed 
in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement 
NEPA. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the NRC finds 
that the proposed action of granting the exemption from the regulations 
in 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11) 
and 72.214, which require the licensee to comply with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of the CoC, in this case limited to the 
specific future loading of four canisters with the CBS variant basket 
design beginning June 2024, would not significantly impact the quality 
of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined that a 
FONSI is appropriate, and an environmental impact statement is not 
warranted.

    The documents identified in the following table are available to 
interested persons through ADAMS, as indicated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    During the period from March 1, 2024, to March 31, 2024, the NRC 
granted 11 exemptions in response to requests submitted by the 
following licensees: Constellation Energy Generation, LLC; Dominion 
Energy Nuclear Connecticut, Inc.; Duke Energy; Energy Harbor Nuclear 
Corp.; Energy Northwest; Entergy Operations Inc.; Florida Power and 
Light; Nextera Energy Duane Arnold, LLC.; Susquehanna Nuclear, LLC; and 
Vistra Operations Company LLC.
    These exemptions temporarily allow the licensee to deviate from 
certain requirements of part 73 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,'' 
subpart T, ``Security Notifications, Reports, and Recordkeeping.'' In 
support of its exemption requests, the licensees agreed to effect site-
specific administrative controls that maintain the approach to 
complying with 10 CFR part 73 in effect prior to the NRC's issuance of 
a final rule, ``Enhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and 
Security Event Notifications,'' which was published in the Federal 
Register on March 14, 2023, and became effective on April 13, 2023 (88 
FR 15864).

II. Availability of Documents

    The tables in this notice provide transparency regarding the number 
and type of exemptions the NRC has issued and provide the facility 
name, docket number, document description, document date, and ADAMS

Attachment--Exemption

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 72-0028, 50-387, and 50-388]

Susquehanna Nuclear, LLC; Susquehanna Steam Electric Station Units 1 
and 2; Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    Susquehanna Nuclear, LLC (Susquehanna) is the holder of Renewed 
Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-14 and NPF-22, which authorize 
operation of the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES), Units 1 and 
2 in Salem Township, Luzerne County, PA (70 miles northeast of 
Harrisburg, PA), pursuant to Part 50 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities.'' The licenses provide, among other things, 
that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now or hereafter in 
effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. Susquehanna is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors 
under 10 CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for 
storage of spent fuel at the SSES ISFSI. Under the terms of the general 
license, Susquehanna stores spent fuel at its SSES ISFSI using the HI-
STORM Flood/Wind (FW) Multi-Purpose Canister (MPC) Storage System in 
accordance with Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1032, Amendment No. 
5.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated March 19, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System [ADAMS] Accession No. ML24079A070) and supplemented 
on March 21, 2024 (ML24081A335), Susquehanna requested an exemption 
from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 
72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that requires SSES to comply 
with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 5 (ML20163A701). If approved, Susquehanna's exemption 
request would accordingly allow SSES to load MPCs with continuous 
basket shims (CBS) (i.e., MPC-89-CBS), an unapproved variant basket 
design, in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, and thus, to load the 
systems in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, are not met.
    Susquehanna currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System under 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at 
the SSES ISFSI. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and

System, developed a variant of the MPC-89 design with CBS, known as 
MPC-89-CBS. Holtec performed a non-mechanistic tip-over analysis with 
favorable results and implemented the CBS variant design under the 
provisions of 10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, tests, and experiments,'' which 
allows licensees to make changes to cask designs without a CoC 
amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After 
evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, the NRC determined 
that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS variant design under 10 
CFR 72.48, as this is not the type of change allowed without a CoC 
amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three Severity Level IV 
violations to Holtec (ML24016A190).
    Susquehanna's near-term loading campaign for the SSES ISFSI 
includes plans to load six MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System beginning in August 2024. While Holtec was required to submit a 
CoC amendment to the NRC to seek approval of the CBS variant design, 
such a process will not be completed in time to inform decisions for 
this near-term loading campaign. Therefore, Susquehanna submitted this 
exemption request to allow for future loading of six MPC-89-CBS 
beginning in August 2024 at the SSES ISFSI. This exemption is limited 
to the use of MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System only for 
the specific near-term planned loading of six new canisters using the 
MPC-89-CBS variant basket design.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow Susquehanna to load six new MPC-89-CBS 
in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, beginning in August 2024, at its 
SSES ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, are not met. 
Susquehanna is requesting an exemption from the provisions in 10 CFR 
part 72 that require the licensee to comply with the terms, conditions, 
and specifications of the CoC for the approved cask model it uses. 
Section 72.7 allows the NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements 
of 10 CFR part 72. This authority to grant exemptions is consistent 
with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and is not otherwise 
inconsistent with NRC's regulations or other applicable laws. 
Additionally, no other law prohibits the activities that would be 
authorized by the exemption. Therefore, the NRC concludes that there is 
no statutory prohibition on the issuance of the requested exemption, 
and the NRC is authorized to grant the exemption by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    This exemption would allow Susquehanna to load six new MPC-89-CBS 
in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, beginning in August 2024, at the 
SSES ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, are not met. In 
support of its exemption request, Susquehanna asserts that issuance of 
the exemption would not endanger life or property because a tip-over or 
handling event is administratively controlled, and that the containment 
boundary would be maintained in such an event. Susquehanna relies, in 
part, on the approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum 
(ML24018A085). The NRC issued this Safety Determination Memorandum to 
address whether, with respect to the enforcement action against Holtec 
regarding this violation, there was any need to take an immediate 
action for the cask systems that were already loaded with non-compliant 
basket designs. The Safety Determination Memorandum documents a risk-
informed approach concluding that, during the design basis event of a 
non-mechanistic tip-over, the fuel in the basket in the MPC-89-CBS 
remains in a subcritical condition.
    Susquehanna also provided site-specific technical information, as 
supplemented, including information explaining why the use of the 
approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum is appropriate 
for determining the safe use of the CBS variant baskets at the SSES 
ISFSI. Specifically, Susquehanna described that the analysis of the 
tip-over design basis event that is relied upon in the NRC's Safety 
Determination Memorandum, which demonstrates that the MPC confinement 
barrier is maintained, is documented in the updated final safety 
analysis report (UFSAR) for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 
1032, Amendment 5, that is used at the SSES site. In addition, the 
handling procedures utilized by Susquehanna comply with the 
requirements of Appendix A of CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, including 
a single failure proof lifting system and redundant drop protection 
features in accordance with applicable codes and standards.
    Additionally, Susquehanna referenced specific information from 
SSES's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 0, that demonstrated the 
combined dose produced by the storage systems on the SSES ISFSI will 
not result in annual doses at the ISFSI controlled area boundary in 
excess of the limits specified in 10 CFR 72.104(a), ``Criteria for 
radioactive materials in effluents and direct radiation from an ISFSI 
or MRS,'' during normal and anticipated operational occurrences, or in 
excess of the limits specified in 72.106, ``Controlled area of an ISFSI 
or MRS,'' during design bases accidents. Specifically, Susquehanna 
described that, in the highly unlikely event of a tip-over, any 
potential fuel damage from a non-mechanistic tip-over event would be 
localized, the confinement barrier would be maintained, and the 
shielding material would remain intact. Susquehanna concluded that 
there is no adverse effect on the shielding or confinement functions 
since there is no effect on occupational or public exposures as a 
result of this accident condition.
    The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by Susquehanna and 
concludes that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or 
property because the administrative controls Susquehanna has in place 
at the SSES ISFSI sufficiently minimize the possibility of a tip-over 
or handling event, and that the containment boundary would be 
maintained in such an event. The staff confirmed that these 
administrative controls comply with the technical specifications and 
UFSAR for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 1032, Amendment 
No. 5, that is used at the SSES site. In addition, the staff confirmed 
that the information provided by Susquehanna regarding SSES's 72.212 
Evaluation Report, Revision 0, demonstrates that the consequences of 
normal and accident conditions would be within the regulatory limits of 
the 10 CFR 72.104 and 10 CFR 72.106. The staff also determined that the 
requested exemption is not related to any aspect of the physical 
security or defense of the SSES ISFSI; therefore, granting the 
exemption would not result in any potential impacts to common defense 
and security.

[[Page 34286]]

    For these reasons, the NRC staff determined that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow Susquehanna to load six new MPC-
89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System beginning in August 2024, 
at the SSES ISFSI, even though the CBS variant basket design is not 
part of the approved CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5. According to 
Susquehanna, the exemption is in the public interest because not being 
able to load fuel into dry storage in the future loading campaign would 
adversely impact Susquehanna's ability to maintain full core offload 
capability, consequently increasing risk and challenges to continued 
safe reactor operation.
    Susquehanna stated that to delay the future loading would impact 
the ability to maintain a healthy margin in the spent fuel pools in 
support of a full core discharge for one reactor unit with a goal of 
providing a full core discharge for both reactor units. Susquehanna 
also stated that the inability to utilize the MPC-89 canister 
containing the CBS basket in the 2024 Spent Fuel Storage campaign 
significantly impacts the ability to effectively manage margin for full 
core discharge capability, because margin reduction results in 
increased inventory in the spent fuel pool that would likely require 
additional fuel moves and an increased reactivity management risk due 
to increased fuel handling operations. Additionally, Susquehanna notes 
that there are logistical concerns that the availability of the 
specialized equipment and personnel resources, which are secured years 
in advance of scheduled campaigns, would have a cascading impact on all 
other scheduled activities that utilize these specialized resources. 
Any delay would lead to a reduction in the margin to capacity in the 
spent fuel pool. Once the spent fuel pool capacity is reached, the 
ability to refuel the operating reactor is limited, thus affecting 
continued reactor operations.
    For the reasons described by Susquehanna in the exemption request, 
the NRC agrees that it is in the public interest to grant the 
exemption. If the exemption is not granted, to comply with the CoC, 
SSES would have to keep spent fuel in the spent fuel pool if it is not 
permitted to be loaded into casks in a future loading, thus impacting 
Susquehanna's ability to effectively manage the margin for full core 
discharge capacity. As explained by Susquehanna, increased inventory of 
fuel in the spent fuel pool could result in the need for additional 
fuel moves and, therefore, an increase in worker doses and the 
potential for fuel handling accidents that accompany increased fuel 
handling operations. Moreover, should spent fuel pool capacity be 
reached, the ability to refuel an operating reactor unit is challenged, 
thus potentially impacting continued reactor operations.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite, and there would be no significant increase in occupational or 
public radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The 
environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact was 
published on April 22, 2024 (89 FR 29369).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants Susquehanna 
an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212(a)(2), 
72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 with respect 
to the future loading in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System of six new 
MPC-89-CBS beginning in August 2024.
    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

    Dated: April 22, 2024.

RIN 3150-AL07


List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: NAC International, 
Inc., NAC-UMS Universal Storage System, Certificate of Compliance No. 
1015, Renewal of Initial Certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 Through 9

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Direct final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its 
spent fuel storage regulations by revising the NAC International, Inc., 
NAC-UMS Universal Storage System listing within the ``List of approved 
spent fuel storage casks'' to renew the initial certificate and 
Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 of Certificate of Compliance No. 1015. The 
renewal of the initial certificate of compliance and Amendment Nos. 1 
through 9 for 40 years changes the certificate's conditions and 
technical specifications to address aging management activities related 
to the structures, systems, and components important to safety of the 
dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain their intended 
functions during the period of extended storage operations.

DATES: This direct final rule is effective July 15, 2024 unless 
significant adverse comments are received by May 29, 2024. If the 
direct final rule is withdrawn as a result of such comments, timely 
notice of the withdrawal will be published in the Federal Register. 
Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical 
to do so, but the NRC is able to ensure consideration only for comments 
received on or before this date. Comments received on this direct final 
rule will also be considered to be comments on a companion proposed 
rule published in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    This direct final rule is limited to the changes contained in the 
initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 to Certificate of 
Compliance (CoC) No. 1015 and does not include other aspects of NAC 
International, Inc., NAC-UMS Universal Storage System design. The NRC 
is using the ``direct final rule procedure'' to issue this renewal 
because this action represents a

[[Page 33185]]

limited and routine change to an existing CoC that is expected to be 
non-controversial and, accordingly, is unlikely to result in 
significant adverse comments. Adequate protection of public health and 
safety continues to be reasonably assured. The amendment to the rule 
will become effective on July 15, 2024. However, if the NRC receives 
any significant adverse comment on this direct final rule by May 29, 
2024, then the NRC will publish a document that withdraws this action 
and will subsequently address the comments received in a final rule as 
a response to the companion proposed rule published in the Proposed 
Rules section of this issue of the Federal Register or as otherwise 
appropriate. In general, absent significant modifications to the 
proposed revisions requiring republication, the NRC will not initiate a 
second comment period on this action.
    A significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and significant if:
    (1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient 
to require a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For 
example, a substantive response is required when:
    (a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its 
position or conduct additional analysis;
    (b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response to clarify or complete the record; or
    (c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously 
addressed or considered by the NRC.
    (2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and 
it is apparent that the rule would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without incorporation of the change or addition.
    (3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than 
editorial) to the rule, CoC, or technical specifications.

III. Background

    Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
requires that ``[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy] shall 
establish a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear 
power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more 
technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, 
approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional 
site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section 133 of the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act states, in part, that ``[t]he Commission shall, by 
rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved 
by the Commission under Section 219(a) [sic: 218(a)] for use at the 
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''
    To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks under a general license by 
publishing a final rule that added a new subpart K in part 72 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 
29181; July 18, 1990). This rule also established a new subpart L in 10 
CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' which 
contains procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of spent 
fuel storage cask designs. The NRC subsequently issued a final rule on 
October 19, 2000 (65 FR 62581), that approved the NAC-UMS Universal 
Storage System design and added it to the list of NRC-approved cask 
designs in Sec.  72.214 as CoC No. 1015.
    On August 28, 2007 (72 FR 49352), the NRC amended the scope of the 
general licenses issued under Sec.  72.210 to include the storage of 
spent fuel in an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) at 
power reactor sites to persons authorized to possess or operate nuclear 
power reactors under 10 CFR part 52. On February 16, 2011 (76 FR 8872), 
the NRC amended subparts K and L in 10 CFR part 72, to extend and 
clarify the term limits for certificates of compliance and to revise 
the conditions for spent fuel storage casks renewals, including adding 
requirements for the safety analysis report to include time-limited 
aging analyses and a description of aging management programs. The NRC 
also clarified the terminology used in the regulations to use 
``renewal'' rather than ``reapproval'' to better reflect that extending 
the term of a currently approved cask design is based on the cask 
design standards in effect at the time the CoC was approved rather than 
current standards.

IV. Discussion of Changes

    The term certified by the initial CoC No. 1015 was 20 years. The 
period of extended operation for each cask begins 20 years after the 
cask is first used by the general licensee to store spent fuel. On 
October 13, 2020, NAC International, Inc. submitted a request to the 
NRC to renew CoC No. 1015 for a period of 40 years beyond the initial 
certificate period and Amendment Nos. 1 through 7 to Certificate of 
Compliance No. 1015 for the NAC-UMS[supreg] Universal Storage System. 
NAC International, Inc. supplemented its request on March 3, 2022; 
March 18, 2022 (adding Amendment Nos. 8 and 9 to the request); July 28, 
2022; and December 21, 2022.
    The NAC-UMS Universal Storage System (the system) is certified as 
described in the Safety Analysis Report (SAR) and in NRC's Safety 
Evaluation Report (SER) accompanying the CoC. The system consists of 
the following components: (1) transportable storage canister (TSC), 
which contains the spent fuel; (2) vertical concrete cask (VCC), which 
contains the TSC during storage; and (3) a transfer cask, which 
contains the TSC during loading, unloading, and transfer operations.
    The original CoC for the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System included 
designs for the storage of five classes of TSCs, including three 
lengths for pressurized-water reactor (PWR) fuel types and two lengths 
for boiling-water reactor (BWR) fuel types. The system included a TSC 
provided with integral fuel baskets for the storage of up to 24 PWR and 
56 BWR spent nuclear fuel assemblies. Subsequently, the NRC issued nine 
amendments to the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System CoC.
    The Nuclear Energy Institute's (NEI) document NEI 14-03, Revision 
2, ``Format, Content and Implementation Guidance for Dry Cask Storage 
Operations-Based Aging Management,'' (December 2016) provides an 
operations-based, learning approach to aging management for the storage 
of spent fuel, which builds on the lessons learned from industry's 
experience with aging management for reactors. The NRC endorsed NEI 14-
03, Revision 2, with clarifications, in Regulatory Guide 3.76, Revision 
0, ``Implementation of Aging Management Requirements for Spent Fuel 
Storage Renewals,'' issued July 2021. Specifically, NEI 14-03 provides 
a framework for sharing operating experience through an industry-
developed database called the ISFSI Aging Management Institute of 
Nuclear Power Operations Database. NEI 14-03 also includes a framework 
for learning aging management programs using aging management 
``tollgates,'' which offer a structured approach for periodically 
assessing operating experience and data from applicable research and 
industry initiatives at specific times during the period of extended 
operation and performing a safety assessment that confirms the safe 
storage of the spent nuclear fuel by

[[Page 33186]]

ensuring the aging management programs continue to effectively manage 
the identified aging effects. The ISFSI Aging Management Institute of 
Nuclear Power Operations Database provides operating experience 
information and a basis to support licensees' future changes to the 
aging management programs. The ISFSI Aging Management Institute of 
Nuclear Power Operations Database and the aging management tollgates 
are considered key elements in ensuring the effectiveness of aging 
management activities and the continued safe storage of spent fuel 
during the period of extended operation.
    NAC International Inc., incorporated periodic tollgate assessments 
as requirements in the renewed certificate of compliance, as 
recommended in NEI 14-03, Revision 2. The implementation of tollgate 
assessments provides reasonable assurance that the aging management 
programs for the canister, the transfer cask, and the overpack will 
continue to effectively manage aging effects during the period of 
extended operation.
    The renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 
9 was conducted in accordance with the renewal provisions in Sec.  
72.240. The NRC's regulations require the safety analysis report for 
the renewal to include time-limited aging analyses that demonstrate 
that structures, systems, and components important to safety will 
continue to perform their intended function for the requested period of 
extended operation and a description of the aging management programs 
for the management of issues associated with aging that could adversely 
affect structures, systems, and components important to safety. The NRC 
spent fuel storage regulations in 10 CFR 72.240 authorize the NRC to 
revise the CoC to include any additional terms, conditions, and 
specifications it deems necessary to ensure the safe operation of the 
cask during the CoC's renewal term. Here, the NRC is adding three new 
conditions to the renewal of the CoC to address aging management 
activities related to the structures, systems, and components important 
to the safety of the dry storage system to ensure that these will 
maintain their intended functions during the period of extended storage 
operations. This would ensure the safe operation of the cask during the 
CoC's renewal term and would allow the use of the NAC-UMS Universal 
Storage System during the approved period of extended operation. 
Additionally, the NRC is amending the condition that describes the 
authorization for use of the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System design 
under the general license.
    The three new conditions added to the renewal of the initial CoC 
and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 are the following:
     A condition requiring the CoC holder to submit an updated 
final safety analysis report within 90 days after the effective date of 
the renewal. The updated final safety analysis report must reflect the 
changes resulting from the review and approval of the renewal of the 
CoC, including the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System final safety 
analysis report. This condition ensures that final safety analysis 
report changes are made in a timely fashion to enable general licensees 
using the storage system during the period of extended operation to 
develop and implement necessary procedures related to renewal and aging 
management activities. The CoC holder is required to continue to update 
the final safety analysis report pursuant to the requirements of Sec.  
72.248.
     A condition requiring each general licensee using the NAC-
UMS Universal Storage System design to include, in the evaluations 
required by Sec.  72.212(b)(5), evaluations related to the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of this CoC amendment as modified (i.e., 
changed or added) as a result of the renewal of the CoC and include, in 
the document review required by Sec.  72.212(b)(6), a review of the 
final safety analysis report changes resulting from the renewal of the 
CoC and the NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the renewal of the 
CoC. The general licensee would also be required to ensure that the 
evaluations required by Sec.  72.212(b)(7) in response to these changes 
are conducted and the determination required by Sec.  72.212(b)(8) is 
made. This condition also makes it clear that to meet the requirements 
in Sec.  72.212(b)(11), general licensees that currently use a NAC-UMS 
Universal Storage System will need to update their Sec.  72.212 
reports, even if they do not put additional NAC-UMS Universal Storage 
Systems into service after the renewal's effective date. These 
evaluations, reviews, and determinations are to be completed before the 
dry storage system enters the period of extended operation (which 
begins 20 years after the first use of the NAC-UMS Universal Storage 
System) or no later than 365 days after the effective date of this 
rule, whichever is later. This will provide general licensees a minimum 
of 365 days to comply with the new terms, conditions, specifications, 
and other changes to the CoC and to make the necessary determinations 
required by Sec.  72.212(b)(8) as to whether activities related to the 
storage of spent nuclear fuel using the renewed CoC involve a change in 
the facility Technical Specifications or requires a license amendment 
for the facility.
     A condition requiring all future amendments and revisions 
to the CoC (i.e., the initial certificate 1015 and Amendment Nos. 1 
through 9) include evaluations of the impacts to aging management 
activities (i.e., time-limited aging analyses and aging management 
programs) to ensure that they remain adequate for any changes to 
structures, systems, and components important to safety within the 
scope of renewal. This condition ensures that future amendments to the 
CoC address the renewed design bases for the CoC, including aging 
management impacts that may arise from any changes to the system in 
proposed future amendments.
    Additionally, the condition for the initial certificate and 
Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 would be amended to reflect changes to the 
scope of the general license granted by Sec.  72.210 that were made 
after the approval of the initial certificate. The authorization is 
amended to allow persons authorized to possess or operate a nuclear 
power reactor under 10 CFR part 52 to use the NAC-UMS Universal Storage 
System under the general license issued under Sec.  72.210.
    The NRC made one corresponding change from the technical 
specifications for the initial CoC and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 by 
adding a section addressing the aging management program. General 
licensees using the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System design during the 
period of extended operation will need to establish, implement, and 
maintain written procedures for each applicable aging management 
program in the final safety analysis report to use the NAC-UMS 
Universal Storage System design during the approved period of extended 
operation. The procedures will need to include provisions for changing 
aging management program elements, as necessary, and within the 
limitations of the approved design bases to address new information on 
aging effects based on inspection findings and/or industry operating 
experience provided to the general licensee during the renewal period. 
The program document must contain a reference to the specific aspect of 
the aging management program element implemented by that procedure, and 
that reference must be maintained even if the procedure is modified.
    General licensees will need to establish and implement these 
written

[[Page 33187]]

procedures prior to entering the period of extended operation (which 
begins 20 years after the first use of the cask system) or no later 
than 365 days after the effective date of this direct final rule, 
whichever is later. The general licensee is required to maintain these 
written procedures for as long as the general licensee continues to 
operate NAC-UMS Universal Storage System in service for longer than 20 
years.
    Under Sec.  72.240(d), the design of a spent fuel storage cask will 
be renewed if (1) the quality assurance requirements in 10 CFR part 72, 
subpart G, ``Quality Assurance,'' are met; (2) the requirements of 10 
CFR 72.236(a) through (i) are met; and (3) the application includes a 
demonstration that the storage of spent fuel has not, in a significant 
manner, adversely affected the structures, systems, and components 
important to safety. Additionally, Sec.  72.240(c) requires that the 
safety analysis report accompanying the application contain time-
limited aging analyses that demonstrate that the structures, systems, 
and components important to safety will continue to perform their 
intended function for the requested period of extended operation and a 
description of the aging management program for management of aging 
issues that could adversely affect structures, systems, and components 
important to safety.
    As documented in the preliminary safety evaluation report, the NRC 
reviewed the application for the renewal of the CoC and the conditions 
in the CoC and determined that the conditions in subpart G, Sec.  
72.236(a) through (i), have been met and that the application includes 
a demonstration that the storage of spent nuclear fuel has not, in a 
significant manner, adversely affected structures, systems, and 
components important to safety. The NRC's safety review determined that 
the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System, with the added terms, conditions, 
and specifications in the CoC and the technical specifications, will 
continue to meet the requirements of 10 CFR part 72 for an additional 
40 years beyond the initial certificate term. Consistent with Sec.  
72.240, the NRC is renewing the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System 
initial certificate 1015 and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9.
    Extending the expiration date of the approval for the initial 
certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 for 40 years and requiring 
the implementation of aging management activities during the period of 
extended operation does not impose any modification or addition to the 
design of a cask system's structures, systems, and components important 
to safety, or to the procedures or organization required to operate the 
system during the initial 20-year storage term certified by the cask's 
initial CoC. General licensees who have loaded these casks, or who load 
these casks in the future under the specifications of the applicable 
renewed CoC, may store spent fuel in these cask system designs for 20 
years without implementing the aging management program. For any casks 
that have been in use for more than 20 years, the general licensee will 
have 365 days to complete the analyses required to use the cask system 
design pursuant to the terms and conditions in the renewed CoC. As 
explained in the 2011 final rule that amended 10 CFR part 72 (76 FR 
8872), the general licensee's authority to use a particular storage 
cask design under an approved CoC will be for at least the term 
certified by the cask's CoC. For casks placed into service before the 
expiration date of the initial certificate, the general licensee's 
authority to use the cask would be extended for an additional 40 years 
from the date the initial certificate expired. For casks placed into 
service after the expiration date of the initial certificate and before 
the effective date of this rule, the general licensee's authority to 
use the cask would last the length of the term certified by the cask's 
CoC (i.e., 40 years after the cask is placed into service). For casks 
placed into service after this rule becomes effective, the general 
licensee's authority to use the cask would expire 40 years after the 
cask is first placed into service.
    This direct final rule revises the NAC International, Inc., NAC-UMS 
Universal Storage System design listing in Sec.  72.214 by renewing, 
for 40 more years, the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 
9 of CoC No. 1015. The renewed CoC includes the changes to the CoC and 
technical specifications previously described. The renewed CoC includes 
terms, conditions, and specifications that will ensure the safe 
operation of the cask during the renewal term and the added conditions 
that will require the implementation of an aging management program. 
The preliminary safety evaluation report describes the new and revised 
conditions in the CoC, the changes to the technical specifications, and 
the NRC staff evaluation.

V. Voluntary Consensus Standards

    The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Pub. 
L. 104-113) requires that Federal agencies use technical standards that 
are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies unless 
the use of such a standard is inconsistent with applicable law or 
otherwise impractical. In this direct final rule, the NRC revises the 
NAC International, Inc., NAC-UMS Universal Storage System design listed 
in Sec.  72.214, ``List of approved spent fuel storage casks.'' This 
action does not constitute the establishment of a standard that 
contains generally applicable requirements.

VI. Agreement State Compatibility

    Under the ``Agreement State Program Policy Statement'' approved by 
the Commission on October 2, 2017, and published in the Federal 
Register on October 18, 2017 (82 FR 48535), this rule is classified as 
Compatibility Category NRC--Areas of Exclusive NRC Regulatory 
Authority. The NRC program elements in this category are those that 
relate directly to areas of regulation reserved to the NRC by the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the provisions of 10 CFR 
chapter I. Therefore, compatibility is not required for program 
elements in this category.

VII. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885).

VIII. Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact

    Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 
and the NRC's regulations in 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection 
Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions,'' 
the NRC has determined that this direct final rule, if adopted, would 
not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of 
the human environment and, therefore, an environmental impact statement 
is not required. The NRC has made a finding of no significant impact 
based on this environmental assessment.

A. The Action

    The action is to amend Sec.  72.214 to change the NAC 
International, Inc., NAC-UMS Universal Storage System listing within 
the ``List of approved spent fuel storage casks'' to renew, for an 
additional 40 years, the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 
through 9 of CoC No. 1015.

[[Page 33188]]

B. The Need for the Action

    This direct final rule renews the initial certificate and Amendment 
Nos. 1 through 9 of CoC No. 1015 for the NAC International, Inc., NAC-
UMS Universal Storage System design within the list of approved spent 
fuel storage casks to allow power reactor licensees to store spent fuel 
at reactor sites in casks with the approved modifications under a 
general license. Specifically, this direct final rule extends the 
expiration date for the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System certificate 
for an additional 40 years, allowing a power reactor licensee to 
continue using the cask design during a period of extended operation 
for a term certified by the cask's renewed CoC.
    The new conditions added to the renewal of the initial CoC and 
Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 are:
     A condition for submitting an updated final safety 
analysis report to the NRC, in accordance with Sec.  72.4, within 90 
days after the effective date of the CoC renewal.
     A condition for renewed CoC use during the period of 
extended operation to ensure that a general licensee's report prepared 
under Sec.  72.212 evaluates the appropriate considerations for the 
period of extended operation. All future amendments and revisions to 
this CoC must include evaluations of the impacts to aging management 
activities.
     The NRC is revising the initial certificate and Amendment 
Nos. 1 through 9 to address the language change in Sec.  72.210 
``General license issue'' and other updates to the regulations.
     A condition requiring all future amendments and revisions 
to the CoC (i.e., the initial certificate 1015 and Amendment Nos. 1 
through 9) include evaluations of the impacts to aging management 
activities (i.e., time-limited aging analyses and aging management 
programs) to ensure that they remain adequate for any changes to 
structures, systems, and components important to safety within the 
scope of renewal.
    The NRC will also make various corrections and editorial changes to 
the CoC and TSs.

C. Environmental Impacts of the Action

    On July 18,1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 
CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general 
license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The potential 
environmental impacts of using NRC-approved storage casks were analyzed 
in the environmental assessment for the 1990 final rule and are 
described in ``Environmental Assessment for Proposed Rule Entitled, 
`Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel in NRC-Approved Storage Casks at Nuclear 
Power Reactor Sites.''' The potential environmental impacts for the 
longer-term use of dry cask designs and the renewal of certificates of 
compliance were analyzed in the environmental assessment for the 2011 
final rule establishing the regulatory requirements for renewing 
certificates of compliance and are described in ``Environmental 
Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact for the Final Rule 
Amending 10 CFR part 72 License and Certificate of Compliance Terms.'' 
The environmental impacts from continued storage were also considered 
in NUREG-2157, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for Continued 
Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel.'' The environmental assessment for the 
renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 of 
CoC No. 1015 tiers off of the environmental assessment for the February 
16, 2011, final rule and NUREG-2157. Tiering on past environmental 
assessments is a standard process under the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
    The NAC-UMS Universal Storage System is designed to mitigate the 
effects of design basis accidents that could occur during storage. 
Design basis accidents account for human-induced events and the most 
severe natural phenomena reported for the site and surrounding area. 
Postulated accidents analyzed for an independent spent fuel storage 
installation, the type of facility at which a holder of a power reactor 
operating license would store spent fuel in casks in accordance with 10 
CFR part 72, can include tornado winds and tornado-generated missiles, 
a design basis earthquake, a design basis flood, an accidental cask 
drop, lightning effects, fire, explosions, and other incidents.
    A renewal reaffirms the original design basis and allows the cask 
to be used during a period of extended operation that corresponds to 
the term certified by the cask's CoC in the renewal. As a condition of 
the renewal, the NRC requires an aging management program that will 
ensure that structures, systems, and components important to safety 
will perform as designers intended during the renewal period. The 
renewal does not reflect a change in design or fabrication of the cask 
system. This renewal does not reflect a significant change in design or 
fabrication of the cask. Because there are no significant design or 
process changes, any resulting occupational exposure or offsite dose 
rates from the renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 
through 9 would remain well within the 10 CFR part 20 limits. The NRC 
has also determined that the design of the cask would continue to 
maintain confinement, shielding, and criticality control in the event 
of an accident. Therefore, these changes would not result in any 
radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts that 
significantly differ from the environmental impacts evaluated in the 
environmental assessment supporting the February 16, 2011, final rule. 
There will be no significant change in the types or significant 
revisions in the amounts of any effluent released, no significant 
increase in the individual or cumulative radiation exposures, and no 
significant increase in the potential for, or consequences from, 
radiological accidents. The NRC determined that the structures, 
systems, and components important to safety will continue to perform 
their intended functions during the requested period of extended 
operation. The NRC determined that the renewed NAC-UMS Universal 
Storage System, when used under the conditions specified in the renewed 
CoC, the technical specifications, and the NRC's regulations, will meet 
the requirements of 10 CFR part 72; therefore, adequate protection of 
public health and safety will continue to be reasonably assured. The 
NRC documented its safety findings in the preliminary SER.
    Based on the previously stated assessments and its preliminary SER 
for the requested renewal of the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System CoC, 
the NRC has determined that the expiration date of this system in 10 
CFR 72.214 can be safely extended for an additional 40 years, and that 
commercial nuclear power reactor licensees can continue using the 
system during this period under a general license without significant 
impacts on the human environment.

D. Alternative to the Action

    The alternative to this action is to deny the renewal of the 
initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 and not issue the 
direct final rule. Consequently, any 10 CFR part 72 general licensee 
that seeks to load spent nuclear fuel into the NAC-UMS Universal 
Storage System after the expiration date of the CoC or that seeks to 
continue storing spent nuclear fuel in the NAC-UMS Universal Storage 
System for longer than the term certified by the cask's CoC for the 
initial certificate (i.e., more than 20 years) would have to request an 
exemption

[[Page 33189]]

from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212 and 72.214 or would have to 
load the spent nuclear fuel into a different approved cask design. 
Under this alternative, those licensees interested in continuing to use 
the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System would have to prepare, and the NRC 
would have to review, a separate exemption request, thereby increasing 
the administrative burden upon the NRC and the costs to each licensee. 
If the general licensee is granted an exemption, the environmental 
impacts would be the same as the proposed action. If the general 
licensee is not granted an exemption, the general licensee would need 
to unload the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System and load the fuel into 
another cask system design, which would result in environmental impacts 
that are greater than for the proposed action because activities 
associated with cask loading and decontamination may result in some 
small liquid and gaseous effluent.

E. Alternative Use of Resources

    Renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 
to CoC No. 1015 would result in no irreversible commitment of 
resources.

F. Agencies and Persons Contacted

    No agencies or persons outside the NRC were contacted in connection 
with the preparation of this environmental assessment.

G. Finding of No Significant Impact

    This direct final rule is to amend Sec.  72.214 to revise the NAC 
International, Inc., NAC-UMS Universal Storage System listing within 
the ``List of approved spent fuel storage casks'' to renew, for an 
additional 40 years, the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 
through 9 of CoC No. 1015. The environmental impacts of the action have 
been reviewed under the requirements in the National Environmental 
Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the NRC's regulations in subpart A 
of 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic 
Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions.'' The renewal does not 
reflect a change in design or fabrication of the cask system as 
approved for the initial certificate or Amendment Nos. 1 through 9. The 
NRC determined that the renewed NAC-UMS Universal Storage System 
design, when used under the conditions specified in the renewed CoC, 
the technical specifications, and the NRC's regulations, will meet the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 72; therefore, adequate protection of 
public health and safety will continue to be reasonably assured.
    Based on the foregoing environmental assessment, the NRC concludes 
that this direct final rule, ``List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage 
Casks: NAC International, Inc., NAC-UMS Universal Storage System, 
Certificate of Compliance No. 1015, Renewal of Initial Certificate and 
Amendment Nos. 1 through 9,'' will not have a significant effect on the 
quality of the human environment. Therefore, the NRC has determined 
that an environmental impact statement is not necessary for this direct 
final rule.

IX. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement

    This direct final rule does not contain any new or amended 
collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing collections of information were 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150-
0132.

Public Protection Notification

    The NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a request for information or an information collection 
requirement unless the requesting document displays a currently valid 
Office of Management and Budget control number.

X. Regulatory Flexibility Certification

    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the 
NRC certifies that this direct final rule will not, if issued, have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
This direct final rule affects only nuclear power plant licensees and 
NAC International, Inc. These entities do not fall within the scope of 
the definition of small entities set forth in the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act or the size standards established by the NRC (Sec.  
2.810).

XI. Regulatory Analysis

    On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 
CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent nuclear fuel under a 
general license in cask designs approved by the NRC. Any nuclear power 
reactor licensee can use NRC-approved cask designs to store spent 
nuclear fuel if (1) it notifies the NRC in advance; (2) the spent fuel 
is stored under the conditions specified in the cask's CoC; and (3) the 
conditions of the general license are met. A list of NRC-approved cask 
designs is contained in Sec.  72.214. On October 19, 2000 (65 FR 
62581), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 CFR part 72 that approved the 
NAC-UMS Universal Storage System design by adding it to the list of 
NRC-approved cask designs in Sec.  72.214.
    On October 13, 2020, NAC International, Inc. submitted a request to 
the NRC to renew, for an additional 40 years, the initial certificate 
and Amendment Nos. 1 through 7 of CoC No. 1015 for the NAC-UMS 
Universal Storage System. NAC International, Inc. supplemented its 
request on March 3, 2022; March 18, 2022 (adding Amendment Nos. 8 and 9 
to the request); July 28, 2022; and December 21, 2022. Because NAC 
International, Inc. filed its renewal application at least 30 days 
before the certificate expiration date of November 20, 2020, pursuant 
to the timely renewal provisions in Sec.  72.240(b), the initial 
issuance of the certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 of CoC No. 
1015 did not expire.
    The alternative to this action is to withhold approval of the 
renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 and 
to require any 10 CFR part 72 general licensee seeking to continue the 
storage of spent nuclear fuel in NAC-UMS Universal Storage System using 
the initial certificate or Amendment Nos. 1 through 9 beyond the 
initial 20-year storage term certified by the cask's initial CoC to 
request an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212 and 
72.214. The term for general licenses would not be extended from 20 
years to 40 years. Under this alternative, each interested 10 CFR part 
72 licensee would have to prepare, and the NRC would have to review, a 
separate exemption request, thereby increasing the administrative 
burden upon the NRC and the costs to each licensee.
    Approval of this direct final rule is consistent with previous NRC 
actions. Further, as documented in the preliminary SER and 
environmental assessment, this direct final rule will have no adverse 
effect on public health and safety or the environment. This direct 
final rule has no significant identifiable impact or benefit on other 
government agencies. Based on this regulatory analysis, the NRC 
concludes that the requirements of this direct final rule are 
commensurate with the NRC's responsibilities for public health and 
safety and the common defense and security. No other available 
alternative is believed to be as satisfactory; therefore, this action 
is recommended.

XII. Backfitting and Issue Finality

    The NRC has determined that the actions in this direct final rule 
do not constitute backfitting because they do not meet the definition 
of backfitting

[[Page 33190]]

under Sec.  72.62. That definition states that backfitting means the 
addition, elimination, or modification, after the license has been 
issued, of the structures, systems, or components of an ISFSI or the 
procedures or organization required to operate an ISFSI. Certificate of 
compliance holders like NAC International, Inc. are not within the 
scope of the backfit rule in Sec.  72.62.
    Certificate of Compliance No. 1015 for the NAC International, Inc., 
NAC-UMS Universal Storage System design, as currently listed in Sec.  
72.214, ``List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' was initially 
approved for a 20-year term. This direct final rule would renew the 
initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 9, extending their 
approval period by 40 years. With this renewal, the term certified by 
the cask's CoC would change from 20 years to 40 years, with the period 
of extended operation beginning 20 years after the cask is placed into 
service. Because the term for the renewal would be longer than the 
initial term certified by the cask's CoC, the general licensee's 
authority to use the cask also would be extended to 40 years. Further, 
the revision to the CoC through the renewal would require 
implementation of aging management programs during the period of 
extended operation.
    Renewing these certificates does not fall within the definition of 
backfitting under Sec.  72.62 during the COC's initial 20-year term. 
General licensees who have loaded these casks, or who load these casks 
in the future under the specifications of the applicable certificate, 
may continue to store spent fuel in these systems for the initial 20-
year storage period authorized by the original certificate. Extending 
the certificates' expiration dates for 40 more years and requiring the 
implementation of aging management programs does not impose any 
modification or addition to the design of the structures, systems, and 
components important to safety of a cask system, or to the procedures 
or organization required to operate the system during this initial 20-
year term certified by the cask's CoC. The aging management programs 
required to be implemented by this renewal are only required to be 
implemented after the storage cask system's initial 20-year service 
period ends.
    General licensees using the existing systems subject to these 
renewals are not required to continue using these systems following the 
end of the initial 20-year storage period. If general licensees choose 
to continue to store spent fuel in the NAC-UMS Universal Storage System 
after the initial 20-year period, these general licensees will be 
required to implement aging management activities for any cask systems 
subject to a renewed CoC. Such continued use is voluntary, so renewing 
the CoC with aging management program conditions does not constitute 
backfitting under Sec.  72.62 for these general licensees.

XIII. Congressional Review Act

    This direct final rule is not a rule as defined in the 
Congressional Review Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing a revision in the NRC's ``Regulatory Guide'' 
series. This series was developed to describe methods that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the 
agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff uses in 
evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to describe 
information that the staff needs in its review of applications for 
permits and licenses.
    The proposed Revision 1 to RG 1.164 was issued with a temporary 
identification of Draft Regulatory Guide, (DG)-1415 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML23187A531). This revision of the guide (Revision 1) updates the 
guidance to provide additional clarification on the NRC's definition of 
counterfeit, fraudulent, and suspect items. This revision also provides 
additional clarity on requirements applicable to the dedication of 
commercial-grade items. In addition, the staff made several editorial 
changes to conform to the current format and content of RGs.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC published notice of the availability of DG-1415 in the 
Federal Register on November 17, 2023 (88 FR 80195), for a 30-day 
public comment period. The public comment period closed on December 18, 
2023. Public comments on DG-1415 and the staff responses to the public 
comments are available under ADAMS Accession No. ML24059A003.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under chapter 
I of title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

III. Congressional Review Act

    This RG is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of RG 1.164, Revision 1, does not constitute backfitting 
as defined in 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC 
Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward 
Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information Requests''; does not affect 
issue finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants''; and does not 
constitute forward fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 
8.4, because, as explained in RG 1.164, Revision 1, licensees would not 
be required to comply with the positions set forth in the RG.

V. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be

considered in future updates and enhancements to the ``Regulatory 
Guide'' series.

remove identifying or contact information.
    If you are requesting or aggregating comments from other persons 
for submission to the NRC, then you should inform those persons not to 
include identifying or contact information that they do not want to be 
publicly disclosed in their comment submission. Your request should 
state that the NRC does not routinely edit comment submissions to 
remove such information before making the comment submissions available 
to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    Because the NRC considers this action to be non-controversial, the 
NRC is publishing this proposed rule concurrently with a direct final 
rule in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal 
Register. The direct final rule will become effective on July 15, 2024. 
However, if the NRC receives any significant adverse comment by May 29, 
2024, then the NRC will publish a document that withdraws the direct 
final rule. If the direct final rule is withdrawn, the NRC will address 
the comments in a subsequent final rule. In general, absent significant 
modifications to the proposed revisions requiring republication, the 
NRC will not initiate a second comment period on this action in the 
event the direct final rule is withdrawn.
    A significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and significant if:
    (1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient 
to require a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For 
example, a substantive response is required when:
    (a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its 
position or conduct additional analysis;
    (b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response to clarify or complete the record; or
    (c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously 
addressed or considered by the NRC.
    (2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and 
it is apparent that the rule would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without incorporation of the change or addition.
    (3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than 
editorial) to the rule.
    For a more detailed discussion of the proposed rule changes and 
associated analyses, see the direct final rule published in the Rules 
and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register.

III. Background

    Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
requires that ``[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy] shall 
establish a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear 
power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more 
technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, 
approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional 
site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section 133 of the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act states, in part, that ``[t]he Commission shall, by 
rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved 
by the Commission under Section 219(a) [sic: 218(a)] for use at the 
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''
    To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks under a general license by 
publishing a final rule that added a new subpart K in part 72 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 
29181; July 18, 1990). This rule also established a new subpart L in 10 
CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' which 
contains procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of spent 
fuel storage cask designs. The NRC subsequently issued a final rule on 
October 19, 2000 (65 FR 62581), that approved the NAC-UMS Universal 
Storage System design and added it to the list of NRC-approved cask 
designs in Sec.  72.214 as Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1015.
    On August 28, 2007 (72 FR 49352), the NRC amended the scope of the 
general licenses issued under 10 CFR 72.210 to include the storage of 
spent fuel in an independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSI) 
at power reactor sites to persons authorized to possess or operate 
nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR part 52. On February 16, 2011 (76 
FR 8872), the NRC amended subparts K and L in 10 CFR part 72, to extend 
and clarify the term limits for certificates of compliance and to 
revise the conditions for spent fuel storage cask renewals, including 
adding requirements for the safety analysis report to include time-
limited aging analyses and a description of aging management programs. 
The NRC also clarified the terminology used in the regulations to use 
``renewal'' rather than ``reapproval'' to better reflect that extending 
the term of a currently approved cask design is based on the cask 
design standards in effect at the time the CoC was approved rather than 
current standards.

IV. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, well-organized manner. 
The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the Plain 
Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain Language in 
Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 31885). The NRC 
requests comment on the proposed rule with respect to clarity and 
effectiveness of the language used.

V. Availability of Documents

    The documents identified in the following table are available to 
interested persons as indicated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC staff is considering issuance of approval of GLE's SPPP and 
TSP for GLE's new headquarters, located in Wilmington, NC, 
approximately 6.2 miles from GLE's existing test loop facility. 
Approval of the SPPP and TSP fulfill the appropriate requirements for 
the NRC to issue a facility clearance to allow for the use, processing, 
storage, reproduction, transmittal, transportation, or handling of NRC 
classified matter at GLE's new headquarters building. Therefore, as 
required by section 51.21 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Criteria for and identification of licensing 
and regulatory actions requiring environmental assessments,'' the NRC 
staff has prepared an EA that analyzes the environmental effects of the 
proposed action. Based on the results of the EA and in accordance with 
10 CFR 51.31(a), the NRC staff has prepared a FONSI for the proposed 
action.
    The NRC staff received a request from GLE for approval of the SPPP 
dated August 25, 2023, supplemented by letter dated March 12, 2024, and 
for approval of the TSP dated August 25, 2023, supplemented by later 
dated October 2, 2023. The NRC staff is also considering the approval 
of a separate but related request for a revised Program Cyber Security 
Plan to extend GLE's classified network to the new headquarters 
building. That Federal Register notice is anticipated to be published 
in the near future and will be available on the Federal rulemaking 
website (https://www.regulations.gov) by searching for Docket ID NRC-
2024-0061.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would allow GLE to expand use of classified 
matter to a new headquarters location approximately 6.2 miles from the 
test loop facility. As proposed, GLE would continue to possess, use, 
and store classified matter at its test loop facility. GLE would also 
possess, use, and store classified matter at the new headquarters 
location and would be authorized to transport classified matter between 
the two sites. Global Laser Enrichment, LLC operates a test loop for 
industrialization of the uranium enrichment process that uses 
separation of isotopes by laser excitation. Although GLE has an NRC-
issued facility security clearance for the test loop facility under 10 
CFR part 95 for protection of classified information, the facility's 
operations, safety, and safeguards programs are authorized under the 
Global Nuclear Fuel--America license SNM-1097.

Need for the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would allow GLE to expand use of classified 
matter to a new headquarters building to facilitate further research 
and development potentially leading to the industrialization of the 
laser enrichment process. The proposed NRC staff approval of the SPPP 
and TSP will support the possession, use, and storage of classified 
matter at the new headquarters as well as transportation of classified 
matter between the GLE test loop facility and the GLE headquarters 
facility.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff has assessed the potential environmental impacts from 
approval of GLE's SPPP and TSP.
    The TSP provides the security procedures for the transportation of 
classified matter from the test loop facility to the headquarters 
facility. The new GLE headquarters facility is located in Wilmington, 
NC. The facility is approximately 0.5 km (0.3 mi) from Interstate 140 
via Castle Hayne Road and approximately 1.9 km (1.2 mi) from Interstate 
140 via U.S. Highway 421. The NRC staff evaluated the potential for 
impacts from the proposed action and concluded that there would be no 
effluent releases and that the proposed action would have no 
significant radiological or non-radiological impacts to environmental 
resources. The NRC staff determined that there would be no significant 
impacts from the proposed action associated with the transportation of 
classified matter. There would be no construction of new roads or other 
improvements to facilitate the transportation of the classified matter. 
With fewer than ten trips, of three or fewer vehicles per trip, between 
the facilities per week, the proposed action is not expected to

[[Page 33405]]

significantly increase traffic levels. Therefore, activities associated 
with transportation of classified material would not result in 
significant environmental impacts. The NRC staff evaluated the 
potential for environmental impacts at the GLE headquarters facility 
from the proposed approval of the SPPP, which involves modifications to 
systems used for security, and concluded that the proposed action would 
not involve any significant construction impacts.
    The NRC staff assessed the impacts of the proposed action on land 
use; historical and cultural resources; visual and scenic resources; 
climatology, meteorology and air quality; geology, minerals, and soils; 
water resources; ecological resources; socioeconomics; noise; traffic 
and transportation; public and occupational health and safety; and 
waste management and concluded that the proposed action would have no 
significant environmental impacts on these resource areas. The NRC 
staff determined that there are no cumulative impacts associated with 
the proposed action.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Under this alternative, GLE would not be granted approval of the SPPP 
and TSP for the new location. Denial of the proposed action would 
result in GLE being unable to conduct operations related to classified 
matter at its headquarters location. The NRC staff concluded that 
environmental impacts from the no-action a lternative would not be 
significant.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was enacted to prevent further 
decline of endangered and threatened species and restore those species 
and their critical habitat. Section 7 of the ESA requires Federal 
agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, regarding actions 
that may affect listed species or designated critical habitats. The NRC 
staff has determined that the proposed action would have no effect on 
threatened or endangered species or critical habitat. Therefore, 
consultation under section 7 of the ESA is not required.
    Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) 
requires Federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings 
on historic properties. As stated in the NHPA, historic properties are 
any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or 
object included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register 
of Historic Places. The NRC staff has determined that the undertaking 
is a type of activity that does not have the potential to cause effects 
on any historic properties that may be present. Therefore, in 
accordance with 36 CFR 800.3(a)(1), the NRC has no further obligations 
under section 106 of the NHPA.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    GLE has requested approval of its SPPP and TSP for the new 
headquarters facility. The NRC staff has prepared an EA as part of its 
review of the proposed action. The proposed action would have no 
significant radiological or non-radiological impacts to environmental 
resources. This FONSI incorporates by reference the EA in Section II of 
this notice. On the basis of this EA, the NRC staff concludes that the 
proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of 
the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined not to 
prepare an environmental impact statement.

IV. Availability of Documents

    The documents identified in the following table are available to 
interested persons through one or more of the following methods, as 
indicated.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated February 14, 2024 (ADAMS Package Accession No. 
ML24045A023), Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (CEG) submitted to 
the NRC an application for license renewal of Facility Operating 
License No. NPF-62 for Clinton Power Station, Unit 1 (CPS), for an 
additional 20 years of operation. This submission initiated the NRC's 
proposed action of determining whether to grant the license renewal 
application. CPS is located in DeWitt County, approximately 7 miles 
east of the city of Clinton in east-central Illinois. The current 
facility operating license for Unit 1 will expire at midnight on April 
17, 2027. The license renewal application was submitted pursuant to 
part 54 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
``Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Power 
Plants,'' and seeks to extend the facility operating license for Unit 1 
to midnight on April 17, 2047. A notice of receipt and availability of 
the application was published in the Federal Register on March 7, 2024 
(89 FR 16591). A notice of acceptance for docketing of the application 
and of opportunity to request a hearing was published in the Federal 
Register on April 18, 2024 (89 FR 27805) and is available on the 
Federal rulemaking website (https://www.regulations.gov) by searching 
for Docket ID NRC-2024-0046

III. Request for Comment

    This notice informs the public of the NRC's intention to conduct 
environmental scoping and prepare an EIS related to the license renewal 
application for CPS, and to provide the public an opportunity to 
participate in the environmental scoping process, as defined in 10 CFR 
51.29 ``Scoping-environmental impact statement and supplement to 
environmental impact statement,'' and 10 CFR 51.116, ``Notice of 
intent.''
    The regulations in 36 CFR 800.8, ``Coordination with the National 
Environmental Policy Act,'' allow agencies to use their National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) 
(NEPA), process to fulfill the

[[Page 33402]]

requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act 
of 1966 (54 U.S.C. 300101, et seq.) (NHPA). Therefore, pursuant to 36 
CFR 800.8(c), the NRC intends to use its process and documentation 
required for the preparation of the EIS on the proposed action to 
comply with Section 106 of the NHPA in lieu of the procedures set forth 
at 36 CFR 800.3 through 800.6.
    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.53(c) and 10 CFR 54.23, CEG submitted 
an environmental report (ER) as part of the license renewal 
application. The ER was prepared pursuant to 10 CFR part 51 and is 
publicly available at ADAMS Accession No. ML24045A279. The ER will also 
be available for viewing at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications/clinton.html.
    The NRC intends to gather the information necessary to prepare a 
plant-specific supplement to NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental Impact 
Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants'' (GEIS) (ADAMS Package 
Accession No. ML13107A023), related to the license renewal application 
for CPS. The NRC is required by 10 CFR 51.95 to prepare a plant-
specific supplement to the GEIS in connection with the renewal of an 
operating license. This notice is being published in accordance with 
NEPA and the NRC's regulations at 10 CFR part 51.
    The supplemental to the GEIS will evaluate the environmental 
impacts of the license renewal for CPS, and reasonable alternatives 
thereto. Possible alternatives to the proposed action include the no 
action alternative and reasonable alternative energy sources.
    As part of its environmental review, the NRC will first conduct a 
scoping process for the EIS and, as soon as practicable thereafter, 
will prepare a draft EIS for public comment. Participation in this 
scoping process by members of the public and local, State, Tribal, and 
Federal government agencies is encouraged. The scoping process for the 
EIS will be used to accomplish the following:
    a. Define the proposed action that is to be the subject of the EIS;
    b. Determine the scope of the EIS and identify the significant 
issues to be analyzed in depth;
    c. Identify and eliminate from detailed study those issues that are 
peripheral or are not significant or that have been covered by prior 
environmental review;
    d. Identify any environmental assessments and other ElSs that are 
being or will be prepared that are related to, but are not part of, the 
scope of the EIS under consideration;
    e. Identify other environmental review and consultation 
requirements related to the proposed action;
    f. Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation 
of the environmental analyses and the NRC's tentative planning and 
decision-making schedule;
    g. Identify any cooperating agencies and, as appropriate, allocate 
assignments for preparation and schedules for completing the EIS to the 
NRC and any cooperating agencies; and
    h. Describe how the EIS will be prepared, including any contractor 
assistance to be used.
    The NRC invites the following entities to participate in scoping:
    a. The applicant, Constellation Energy Generation, LLC;
    b. Any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or that is 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    c. Affected State and local government agencies, including those 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    d. Any affected Indian Tribe;
    e. Any person who requests or has requested an opportunity to 
participate in the scoping process; and
    f. Any person who has petitioned or intends to petition for leave 
to intervene under 10 CFR 2.309.

IV. Public Scoping Meeting

    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.26(b), the scoping process for an EIS 
may include a public scoping meeting to help identify significant 
issues related to the proposed action and to determine the scope of 
issues to be addressed in the EIS.
    The NRC is announcing that it will hold two public scoping meetings 
as online webinars for the CPS license renewal application. The webinar 
will include a telephone line for members of the public to provide 
comments. A court reporter will transcribe all comments received during 
the webinars. To be considered, comments must be provided either at the 
transcribed public meeting or in writing, as discussed in the ADDRESSES 
section of this document. The public scoping webinars will be held on 
May 7, 2024, at 6 p.m. ET and May 9, 2024, at 1 p.m. ET. Persons 
interested in attending this online webinar should monitor the NRC's 
Public Meeting Schedule website at https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg for 
additional information, agendas for the meeting, and access information 
for the webinar. Please contact Ashley Waldron no later than May 2, 
2024, if accommodations or special equipment is needed to attend or to 
provide comments, so that the NRC staff can determine whether the 
request can be accommodated.
    The public scoping meeting will include: (1) an overview by the NRC 
staff of the environmental and safety review processes, the proposed 
scope of the EIS, and the proposed review schedule; and (2) the 
opportunity for interested government agencies, organizations, and 
individuals to submit comments or suggestions on environmental issues 
or the proposed scope of the CPS license renewal EIS.
    Participation in the scoping process for the CPS license renewal 
EIS does not entitle participants to become parties to the proceeding 
to which the EIS relates. Matters related to participation in any 
hearing are outside the scope of matters to be discussed at this public 
meeting.

Kairos Power, LLC; Hermes 2; Draft Environmental Assessment and 
Draft Finding of No Significant Impact

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice of availability and request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for 
public comment a draft environmental assessment (EA) and draft finding 
of no significant impact (FONSI) for proposed issuance of construction 
permits (CP) to Kairos Power, LLC (Kairos). The CPs would authorize the 
construction of two non-power test reactors termed Hermes 2, adjacent 
to the Hermes test reactor (Hermes), on a 185-acre site located in Oak 
Ridge, Tennessee. Kairos was issued a CP for Hermes, Construction 
Permit No. CPTR-6, on December 14, 2023. The Hermes 2 test reactors 
would demonstrate additional key elements of the Kairos Power Fluoride 
Salt-Cooled, High Temperature Reactor technology for possible future 
commercial deployment. The technology is an advanced nuclear reactor 
technology that leverages TRI-structural ISOtropic (TRISO) particle 
fuel in pebble form combined with a low-pressure fluoride salt coolant. 
The NRC has prepared a draft EA and draft FONSI that consider the 
environmental impacts associated with issuing the CPs.

II. Introduction

    On July 14, 2023, Kairos submitted, pursuant to part 50 of title 10 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities,'' an application for CPs for the 
Hermes 2 test reactor facility (a ``testing facility'' as defined in 10 
CFR 50.2), that would consist of two fluoride salt-cooled test reactor 
units at the East Tennessee Technology Park in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. A 
notice of receipt and availability of the application was published in 
the Federal Register on August 4, 2023 (88 FR 51876). The Hermes 2 
site, adjacent to the Hermes test reactor, is situated in the Heritage 
Center Industrial Park of the East Tennessee Technology Park that was 
established by the City of Oak Ridge on land formerly owned by the U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE) for the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant 
(ORGDP). The site was occupied by DOE Buildings K-31 and K-33, both of 
which were part of the ORGDP.
    The NRC staff determined that Kairos submitted the application in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.101(a)(5), and a notice of the acceptability 
of docketing of Kairos's CP application was published in the Federal 
Register on September 15, 2023 (88 FR 63632). The docket numbers 
established for this application are 50-611 and 50-612 for Units 1 and 
2, respectively. A notice of opportunity to request a hearing and 
petition for leave to intervene (88 FR 81439) was published in the 
Federal Register on November 22, 2023.
    Section 104 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and its 
implementing regulations authorize the NRC to issue CPs for testing 
facilities. To issue a CP, the NRC is required to consider the 
environmental impacts of the proposed action under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). The NRC's environmental 
protection regulations that implement NEPA in 10 CFR part 51 identify 
actions for which the NRC prepares an environmental impact statement 
(EIS). CPs for test reactors are an action identified as requiring an 
EIS.
    However, based on a review of the environmental report (ER) 
submitted as part of the CP application for Hermes 2 and the results of 
the EIS recently issued for the Hermes test reactor, the NRC staff 
concluded that it would be prudent to first prepare a draft 
environmental assessment (EA) to determine whether preparation of an 
EIS would be necessary or whether a finding of no significant impact 
(FONSI) could be issued for the Hermes 2 CP based on factors unique to 
the Hermes 2 CP application. These factors include: (1) the similar 
design of Hermes 2 and Hermes, (2) the proposed siting of Hermes 2 
within a few hundred feet of Hermes, (3) the industrial nature and 
heavy prior disturbance of the site, (4) the recent thorough NEPA 
review performed by the staff as published in its final EIS for Hermes, 
and (5) the staff's final EIS for Hermes covering the same site as 
Hermes 2 and documenting all impacts as SMALL.
    The NRC staff has prepared a draft EA and draft FONSI documenting 
its environmental review of the Hermes 2 CP application. Based on the 
environmental review, the NRC staff has made a preliminary 
determination that the proposed action would not significantly affect 
the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the NRC staff has made 
a preliminary determination that it will not prepare an EIS and that a 
draft FONSI appears warranted.
    The staff will consider comments received on the draft EA and draft 
FONSI over a 30-day public comment period from Federal, State, local, 
and Tribal officials, and members of the public. After consideration of 
these public comments, the NRC staff will make a final determination as 
to whether preparation of an EIS is necessary or whether a FONSI can be 
issued for the Hermes 2 CP application. However, exemptions from 
certain regulations in 10 CFR part 51 would be necessary to issue a 
final EA and final FONSI to support issuance of the Hermes 2 CPs. In 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.6, the NRC may grant exemptions from the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 51 if it determines that the exemptions are 
authorized by law and are otherwise in the public interest.

III. Summary of Draft Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action and Need

    The proposed action is for the NRC to issue CPs to Kairos 
authorizing construction of the two proposed Hermes 2 reactors. The NRC 
issuance of CPs would constitute authorization for Kairos to proceed 
with the construction of the Hermes 2 reactors, two fluoride salt-
cooled test reactor units, at the East Tennessee Technology Park in Oak 
Ridge, Tennessee.
    The issuance of a CP is a separate licensing action from the 
issuance of an operating license (OL). If the NRC issues CPs for Hermes 
2 and Kairos were to seek NRC approval to operate Hermes 2, then Kairos 
would have to submit a separate application for OLs pursuant to the 
NRC's regulations, and Kairos would have to obtain NRC approval before 
it could operate the Hermes 2 test reactors. The NRC staff would review 
any application for an OL for Hermes 2 for new and significant 
information related to the environmental impacts of operating and 
decommissioning Hermes 2 that might alter the staff's conclusions made 
in the EA for the CP application.
    The need for Hermes 2 is to demonstrate key elements of the Kairos 
Power Fluoride Salt-Cooled, High Temperature Reactor technology for 
possible future commercial deployment. The technology is an advanced 
nuclear reactor technology that leverages TRI-structural ISOtropic 
particle fuel in pebble form combined with a low-pressure fluoride salt 
coolant. Hermes 2 would support Kairos's reactor development program, 
which relies on learning and risk reduction by narrowing the design 
space through progressive test cycles. Construction and operation of 
Hermes 2 also would provide validation and qualification data to 
support potential future commercial reactors using the Kairos

[[Page 32464]]

Power Fluoride Salt-Cooled, High Temperature Reactor technology.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    In the draft EA, the NRC staff assessed the potential direct and 
indirect environmental impacts from the proposed action associated with 
the following relevant resource areas: land use and visual resources; 
air quality and noise; hydrogeology and water resources; ecological 
resources; historic and cultural resources; socioeconomics and 
environmental justice; human health; nonradiological waste management; 
uranium fuel cycle and radiological waste management; transportation of 
radioactive material; and postulated accidents. The NRC staff also 
considered the cumulative impacts from past, present, and reasonably 
foreseeable future actions when combined with the proposed action.
    The NRC staff determined that the environmental impacts of the 
proposed action would be SMALL for each potentially affected 
environmental resource, meaning that the environmental effects are not 
detectable or are so minor that they will neither destabilize nor 
noticeably alter any important attribute of the resource. In addition, 
the NRC staff determined that the projected effects of climate change 
would not alter any of the impact determinations described in the EA. 
Furthermore, the NRC staff found that there would be no significant 
negative cumulative impact to any resource area from the proposed 
action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
future actions.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff identified a range of reasonable alternatives to the 
proposed action and the environmental impacts of the alternatives as 
appropriate. The NRC staff determined that there are no alternatives 
that meet the need for the proposed action and that are environmentally 
preferrable to the proposed action.

IV. Draft Finding of No Significant Impact

    The proposed action before the NRC is whether to issue CPs (one for 
each unit) to Kairos to authorize construction of the two proposed 
reactors (units) making up the Hermes 2 project. The NRC has conducted 
an environmental review of a request for NRC issuance of CPs for the 
Hermes 2 project and prepared an EA. This draft FONSI incorporates by 
reference the EA summarized in Section II of this notice and referenced 
in Section V of this notice. On the basis of the EA, and its 
determination that the environmental impacts would be SMALL for each 
potentially affected resource area, the NRC staff has preliminarily 
determined that the proposed action would not have a significant effect 
on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC staff has 
made a preliminary determination that preparation of an EIS is not 
required for the proposed action and that a FONSI is appears warranted.
    This finding and the related environmental documents referenced 
throughout the EA are available for public inspection as discussed in 
the EA and Section I of this notice. The NRC's staff's determination is 
tentative. Before making a final determination, the NRC staff also will 
consider comments received on the draft EA and draft FONSI over a 30-
day public comment period from Federal, State, local, and Tribal 
officials, and members of the public. Once NRC makes a final 
determination, it will publish the final EA and final FONSI or proceed 
to prepare an EIS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing a revision in the NRC's ``Regulatory Guide'' 
series. This series was developed to describe methods that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the 
agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff uses in 
evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to describe 
information that the staff needs in its review of applications for 
permits and licenses.
    The proposed Revision 3 to RG 1.128 was issued with a temporary

[[Page 31602]]

identification of Draft Regulatory Guide, (DG)-1421 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML23277A276.) This revision of this guide (Revision 3) describes an 
approach that is acceptable to the NRC staff to meet the regulatory 
requirements for installation, inspection, and testing for Class 1E 
power, instrumentation, and control equipment at production and 
utilization facilities. RG 1.128, Revision 3 endorses, with 
clarifications, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
(IEEE) Standard 484-2019, ``IEEE Recommended Practice for Installation 
Design and Installation of Vented Lead-Acid Batteries for Stationary 
Applications.''

II. Additional Information

    The NRC published a notice of the availability of DG-1421 in the 
Federal Register on January 8, 2024 (89 FR 895) for a 30-day public 
comment period. The public comment period closed on February 7, 2024. 
Public comments on DG-1421 and the staff responses to the public 
comments are available in ADAMS under Accession No. ML24052A078.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under chapter 
1 of title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

III. Congressional Review Act

    This RG is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of RG 1.128, Revision 3, does not constitute backfitting 
as that term is defined in 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as 
described in NRC Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of 
Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information 
Requests;'' does not affect the issue finality of an approval issued 
under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for 
Nuclear Power Plants;'' and does not constitute forward fitting as that 
term is defined and described in MD 8.4 because, as explained in RG 
1.128, Revision 3, licensees would not be required to comply with the 
positions set forth in the RG.

V. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs.

II. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing for public comment draft Site-Specific 
Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants 
Supplement 26, Second Renewal Regarding Subsequent License Renewal for 
Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, Unit 1, NUREG-1437, regarding the 
proposed subsequent renewal of Renewed Facility Operating License No. 
DPR-22, for an additional 20 years of operation for Monticello. Draft 
Site-Specific Supplement 26, Second Renewal, includes a preliminary 
analysis that evaluates the environmental impacts of the proposed 
action and alternatives to the proposed action. It considers the 
impacts of all SLR issues applicable to Monticello SLR on a site-
specific basis.
    Based on the NRC staff's (i) review of the SLR application, which 
includes the environmental report, supplemental documents, and the 
licensee's responses to the NRC staff's requests for additional 
information; (ii) consultation with Federal, State, Tribal, and local 
governmental agencies and consideration of input from other 
stakeholders; and (iii) independent environmental review as documented 
in the draft site-specific EIS, the NRC staff's preliminary 
recommendation is that the adverse environmental impacts of subsequent 
license renewal for Monticello are not so great that preserving the 
option of subsequent license renewal for energy-planning decisionmakers 
would be unreasonable.
    Detailed information about the subsequent license renewal process 
can be found on the NRC's public website, under Reactor License 
Renewal, at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal.html. Materials involving the request to renew the operating 
licenses for Monticello are available for public inspection at the 
NRC's PDR, and at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/subsequent-license-renewal.html.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Docket Nos. 72-1048, 50-390, and 50-391

Tennessee Valley Authority; Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2; 
Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is the holder of Facility 
Operating License Nos. NPF-90 and NPF-96, which authorize operation of 
the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN), Units 1 and 2 in Rhea County, 
Tennessee, pursuant to Part 50 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities.'' The licenses provide, among other things, 
that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now or hereafter in 
effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. TVA is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors under 10 
CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for storage of 
spent fuel at the WBN ISFSI. Under the terms of the general license, 
TVA stores spent fuel at its WBN ISFSI using the HI-STORM Flood/Wind 
(FW) Multi-Purpose Canister (MPC) Storage System in accordance with 
Certificate of Compliance (CoC) No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 
1.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated February 28, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access 
and Management System [ADAMS] Accession No. ML24059A369), and 
supplemented on March 18, 2024 (ML24078A257), TVA requested an 
exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 
72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require WBN to comply 
with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1 (ML16112A309). If approved, TVA's 
exemption request would accordingly allow WBN to load MPCs with 
continuous basket shims (CBS) (i.e., MPC-37-CBS), an unapproved, 
variant basket design, in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, and thus, 
to load the systems in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, 
and specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1 
are not met.
    TVA currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System under CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1, for dry storage of spent nuclear 
fuel in MPC-37 at the WBN ISFSI. Holtec International (Holtec), the 
designer and manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, 
developed a variant of the design with CBS for the MPC-37, known as 
MPC-37-CBS. Holtec performed a non-mechanistic tip-over analysis with 
favorable results and implemented the CBS variant design under the 
provisions of 10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, tests, and experiments,'' which 
allows licensees to make changes to cask designs without a CoC 
amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After 
evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, the NRC determined 
that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS variant design under 10 
CFR 72.48, as this is not the type of change allowed without a CoC 
amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three Severity Level IV 
violations to Holtec (ML24016A190).
    TVA's near-term loading campaign for the WBN ISFSI includes plans 
to load five MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System beginning 
in July 2024. While Holtec was required to submit a CoC amendment to 
the NRC to seek approval of the CBS variant design, such a process will 
not be completed in time to inform decisions for this near-term loading 
campaign. Therefore, TVA submitted this exemption request in order to 
allow for future loading of five MPC-37-CBS beginning in July 2024 at 
the WBN ISFSI. This exemption is limited to the use of MPC-37-CBS in 
the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System only for the specific near-term 
planned loading of five canisters using the MPC-37-CBS variant basket 
design.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow TVA to load five MPC-37-CBS in the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System, beginning July 2024, at its WBN ISFSI in a 
storage condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in 
the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1, are not met. WBN is 
requesting an exemption from the provisions in 10 CFR part 72 that 
require the licensee to comply with the terms, conditions, and 
specifications of the CoC for the approved cask model it uses. Section 
72.7 allows the NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR 
part 72. This authority to grant exemptions is consistent with the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and is not otherwise 
inconsistent with NRC's regulations or other applicable laws. 
Additionally, no other law prohibits the activities that would be 
authorized by the exemption. Therefore, the NRC concludes that there is 
no statutory prohibition on the issuance of the requested exemption, 
and the NRC is authorized to grant the exemption by law.

[[Page 31228]]

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    This exemption would allow TVA to load five MPC-37-CBS in the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System, beginning July 2024, at the WBN ISFSI in a 
storage condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications in 
the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1, are not met. In 
support of its exemption request, TVA asserts that issuance of the 
exemption would not endanger life or property because a tip-over or 
handling event is administratively controlled, and that the containment 
boundary would be maintained in such an event. TVA relies, in part, on 
the approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum 
(ML24018A085). The NRC issued this Safety Determination Memorandum to 
address whether, with respect to the enforcement action against Holtec 
regarding this violation, there was any need to take an immediate 
action for the cask systems that were already loaded with non-compliant 
basket designs. The Safety Determination Memorandum documents a risk-
informed approach concluding that, during the design basis event of a 
non-mechanistic tip-over, the fuel in the basket in the MPC-37-CBS 
remains in a subcritical condition.
    TVA also provided site-specific technical information, as 
supplemented, including information explaining why the use of the 
approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum is appropriate 
for determining the safe use of the CBS variant baskets at the WBN 
ISFSI. Specifically, TVA described that the analysis of the tip-over 
design basis event that is relied upon in the NRC's Safety 
Determination Memorandum, which demonstrates that the MPC confinement 
barrier is maintained, is documented in the updated final safety 
analysis report (UFSAR) for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 
1032, Amendment 0, Revision No. 1 that is used at the WBN site. TVA 
stated the transporter for handling of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System at the WBN ISFSI has redundant drop protection features and was 
designed, fabricated, and tested in accordance with the applicable 
codes described in the CoC No. 1032.
    Additionally, TVA provided specific information from WBN's 72.212 
Evaluation Report, Revision 5, indicating the calculated total values 
for annual dose to any real individual who is located beyond the 
controlled area are shown to be well below the limits required by 10 
CFR 72.104(a), ``Criteria for radioactive materials in effluents and 
direct radiation from an ISFSI or MRS.'' The analysis of a design basis 
accident scenario also demonstrates compliance with 72.106, 
``Controlled area of an ISFSI or MRS.'' Specifically, TVA described 
that, in the highly unlikely event of a tip-over, any potential fuel 
damage from a non-mechanistic tip-over event would be localized, the 
confinement barrier would be maintained, and the shielding material 
would remain intact. Coupled with the distance of the WBN ISFSI to the 
site area boundary, TVA concluded that compliance with 72.104 and 
72.106 is not impacted by approving this exemption request.
    The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by TVA and 
concludes that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or 
property because the administrative controls TVA has in place at the 
WBN ISFSI sufficiently minimize the possibility of a tip-over or 
handling event, and that the containment boundary would be maintained 
in such an event. The staff confirmed that these administrative 
controls comply with the technical specifications and UFSAR for the HI-
STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC No. 1032, Amendment 0, Revision No. 1 
that is used at the WBN site. In addition, the staff confirmed that the 
information provided by TVA regarding WBN's 72.212 Evaluation Report, 
Revision 5, demonstrates that the consequences of normal and accident 
conditions would be within the regulatory limits of the 10 CFR 72.104 
and 10 CFR 72.106. The staff also determined that the requested 
exemption is not related to any aspect of the physical security or 
defense of the WBN ISFSI; therefore, granting the exemption would not 
result in any potential impacts to common defense and security.
    For these reasons, the NRC staff has determined that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow WBN to load five MPC-37-CBS in 
the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System beginning in July 2024, at the WBN 
ISFSI, even though the CBS variant basket design is not part of the 
approved CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1. According to 
TVA, the exemption is in the public interest because not being able to 
load fuel into dry storage in the future loading campaign would impact 
TVA's ability to offload fuel from the WBN reactor units, consequently 
impacting continued safe reactor operation.
    TVA stated that to delay the future loading would impact the 
ability to effectively manage the margin to full core discharge reserve 
in the WBN Unit 1 and Unit 2 spent fuel pools. WBN's upcoming loading 
campaign was originally scheduled to begin on January 29, 2024, but was 
postponed until July 2024 . Any further delay would lead to 
insufficient space in the spent fuel pool for core offload and the 
shutdown of WBN Unit 2, which in turn would potentially impact the 
energy supply in the area. According to TVA, the planned July 2024 
loading campaign is the latest, and only opportunity for cask loading 
to avoid loss of full core reserve in 2025.
    For the reasons described by TVA in the exemption request, the NRC 
agrees that it is in the public interest to grant the exemption. If the 
exemption is not granted, in order to comply with the CoC, WBN would 
have to keep spent fuel in the spent fuel pool if it is not permitted 
to be loaded into casks for future loading. This would impact the 
ability to manage the margin for full core reserve in the WBN spent 
fuel pool. Increased inventory in the spent fuel pool would likely 
require additional fuel moves, which could in turn increase dose to 
workers and the risk of accidents during fuel handling operations. 
Moreover, once the spent fuel pool capacity is reached, the ability to 
refuel the operating reactor is limited, thus affecting continued 
reactor operations. As described by TVA, this scenario would possibly 
result in the shutdown of one unit, which could potentially impact the 
energy supply in the area.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite,

[[Page 31229]]

and there would be no significant increase in occupational or public 
radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The environmental 
assessment and the finding of no significant impact was published on 
April 17, 2024 (89 FR 27465).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants TVA an 
exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212(a)(2), 
72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 with respect 
to the future loading in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System of five 
MPC-37-CBS beginning in July 2024.
    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC staff conducted an operational readiness and management 
measures verification review and prepared inspection reports 
documenting its findings in accordance with the requirements of the 
NRC's Inspection Manual. The reports are available for review and are 
listed in Section II of this notice. The publication of this notice 
satisfies the requirements of paragraph 70.32(k) of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), and section 193(c) of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    License Condition 11 of the ACP license authorized the HALEU 
demonstration program on June 11, 2021, but prohibited the introduction 
of

[[Page 29369]]

UF6 into the HALEU demonstration cascade modules until the 
NRC completed an operational readiness and management measures 
verification review. The NRC staff's review verified that the licensee 
was in compliance with the performance requirements of 10 CFR 70.61, 
and that the systems, structures, and components designed to support 
safe operation of the HALEU Demonstration Cascade were constructed in 
accordance with license requirements. By letter dated June 12, 2023, 
the NRC authorized the American Centrifuge Operating, LLC (ACO) to 
introduce UF6 into the HALEU demonstration cascade module to 
produce Category III quantities of special nuclear material (SNM) at 
the ACP. By letter dated September 21, 2023, the NRC authorized ACO to 
commence enrichment operations in the HALEU demonstration cascade 
module to produce Category II quantities of SNM up to the quantity 
approved on June 11, 2021 at the ACP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is reviewing an exemption request from Susquehanna, dated 
March 19, 2024, and supplemented on March 21, 2024. Susquehanna is 
requesting an exemption, pursuant to section 72.7 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), in paragraphs 72.212(a)(2), 
72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require 
Susquehanna to comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of 
the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5. If approved, the exemption would 
allow Susquehanna to load six new MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System at the SSES ISFSI in a storage condition where the 
terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment 
No. 5, are not met.

II. Environmental Assessment

Background

    SSES is located in Salem Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, 
just west of the Susquehanna River. The largest community within 10 
miles (16 km) of the site is the borough of Berwick, which is 
approximately 5 miles (8 km) southwest of SSES, in Luzerne County, 
Pennsylvania. The nearest major metropolitan areas are Wilkes-Barre, 
Pennsylvania, approximately 20 mi (32 km) to the northeast, and 
Allentown, Pennsylvania, approximately 50 mi (80 km) to the southeast. 
Unit 1 began operating in 1981 and Unit 2 began operating in 1982. 
Susquehanna has been storing spent fuel in an ISFSI at SSES under a 
general license as authorized by 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' Susquehanna 
currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System under CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 5, for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at the SSES 
ISFSI.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The CoC is the NRC approved design for each dry cask storage 
system. The proposed action would exempt the applicant from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 only as these requirements pertain to the use 
of the MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System for the near-
term planned loading of the canisters. The exemption would allow SSES 
to load six new MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the 
SSES ISFSI, despite the MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System not being in compliance with the terms, conditions, and 
specifications in CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5.
    The HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC provides the requirements, 
conditions, and operating limits necessary for use of the system to 
store spent fuel. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and 
manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, developed a variant 
of the design with CBS for the MPC-89, known as MPC-89-CBS. Holtec 
originally implemented the CBS variant design under the provisions of 
10 CFR 72.48, which allows licensees to make changes to cask designs 
without a CoC amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 
72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, 
the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS 
variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this was not the type of change 
allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three 
Severity Level IV violations to Holtec. Susquehanna plans to load six 
new MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System beginning in 
August 2024. This exemption considers the near-term planned loading of 
the six canisters with the CBS variant basket design.

Need for the Proposed Action

    Susquehanna requested this exemption to allow SSES to load six new 
MPC-89-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the SSES ISFSI for 
the future loading campaign scheduled to begin in August 2024.
    Approval of the exemption request would allow Susquehanna to 
effectively manage the margin for full core reserve in the SSES spent 
fuel pool to enable refueling and offloading fuel from the reactor. It 
would also allow Susquehanna to manage logistical considerations, such 
as personnel and specific equipment resources, needed to support 
refueling outages at SSES and across the industry.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    This EA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting 
an exemption from the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 5. The exemption would allow six new MPC-89-CBS to 
be loaded in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System in a near-term loading 
campaign beginning in August 2024 and maintained in storage at the SSES 
ISFSI.
    The potential environmental impacts of storing spent nuclear fuel 
in NRC-approved storage systems have been documented in previous 
assessments. On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC amended 10 CFR 
part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general 
license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final 
rule analyzed the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved 
storage casks. The EA for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 5, (85 FR 28479), published in 2015, tiers off of 
the EA issued for the July 18, 1990, final rule. ``Tiering'' off 
earlier EAs is a standard process encouraged by the regulations 
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) that 
entails the use of impact analyses of previous EAs to bound the impacts 
of a proposed action where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System is designed to mitigate the effects of design basis 
accidents that could occur during storage. Considering the specific 
design requirements for the accident conditions, the design of the cask 
would prevent loss of containment, shielding, and criticality control. 
If there is no loss of containment, shielding, or criticality control, 
the environmental impacts would not be significant.
    The exemptions requested by Susquehanna at the SSES site as they 
relate to CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5, for the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System are limited to the use of the CBS variant basket design 
only for the near-term planned loading of six new canisters utilizing 
the CBS variant basket design. The staff has determined that this 
change in the basket would not result in either radiological or non-
radiological environmental impacts that significantly differ from the 
environmental impacts evaluated in the environmental assessment 
supporting the issuance of CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 5. If the 
exemption is granted, there would be no significant change in the types 
or amounts of any effluents released, no significant increase in 
individual or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure, and 
no significant increase in the potential for or consequences from 
radiological accidents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that 
there would be no significant environmental impacts associated with the 
proposed action.

Alternative to the Proposed Action

    The staff considered the no-action alternative. The no-action 
alternative

[[Page 29371]]

(denial of the exemption request) would require Susquehanna to keep the 
spent fuel in the spent fuel pool until older design canisters can be 
fabricated and delivered to site. Not allowing the planned future 
loading campaign could affect Susquehanna's ability to manage pool 
capacity, reactor fuel offloading, and refueling. It could also impact 
Susquehanna's availability to manage personnel resources and coordinate 
refueling outages at SSES and across the industry. The NRC has 
determined that these potential impacts of the no-action alternative 
could be avoided by proceeding with the proposed exemption, especially 
given that the staff has concluded in NRC's Safety Determination 
Memorandum, issued with respect to the enforcement action against 
Holtec regarding these violations, that fuel can be stored safety in 
the MPC-89-CBS.

Agencies Consulted

    The NRC provided the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental 
Protection (PDEP) a copy of this draft EA for review by an email dated 
April 10, 2024. On April 12, 2024, the PDEP provided its concurrence by 
email.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action have been reviewed 
in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement 
NEPA. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the NRC finds 
that the proposed action of granting the exemption from the regulations 
in 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11) 
and 72.214, which require the licensee to comply with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of the CoC, would not significantly 
impact the quality of the human environment. The exemption in this case 
would be limited to specific future loading of six canisters with the 
CBS variant design beginning in August 2024. Accordingly, the NRC has 
determined that a FONSI is appropriate, and an environmental impact 
statement is not warranted.

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    This direct final rule is limited to the changes contained in the 
Initial Certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 to Certificate of 
Compliance No. 1026 and does not include other aspects of the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System Cask System 
design. The NRC is using the ``direct final rule procedure'' to issue 
this amendment because it represents a limited and routine change to an 
existing certificate of compliance that is expected to be non-
controversial. Adequate protection of public health and safety 
continues to be reasonably assured. The amendment to the rule will 
become effective on July 3, 2024. However, if the NRC receives any 
significant adverse comment on this direct final rule by May 20, 2024, 
then the NRC will publish a document that withdraws this action and 
will subsequently address the comments received in a final rule as a 
response to the companion proposed rule published in the Proposed Rules 
section of this issue of the Federal Register or as otherwise 
appropriate. In general, absent significant modifications to the 
proposed revisions requiring republication, the NRC will not initiate a 
second comment period on this action.
    A significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and significant if:
    (1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient 
to require a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For 
example, a substantive response is required when:
    (a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its 
position or conduct additional analysis;
    (b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response to clarify or complete the record; or
    (c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously 
addressed or considered by the NRC.
    (2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and 
it is apparent that the rule would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without incorporation of the change or addition.
    (3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than 
editorial) to

[[Page 28574]]

the rule, certificate of compliance, or technical specifications (TS).

III. Background

    Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
requires that ``[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy] shall 
establish a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear 
power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more 
technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, 
approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional 
site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section 133 of the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act states, in part, that ``[t]he Commission shall, by 
rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved 
by the Commission under Section 219(a) [sic: 218(a)] for use at the 
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''
    To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks under a general license by 
publishing a final rule that added a new subpart K in part 72 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 
29181; July 18, 1990). This rule also established a new subpart L in 10 
CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' which 
contains procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of spent 
fuel storage cask designs. The NRC subsequently issued a final rule on 
January 16, 2001 (66 FR 3444), that approved the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System design and 
added it to the list of NRC-approved cask designs in Sec.  72.214 as 
Certificate of Compliance No. 1026.
    On August 28, 2007 (72 FR 49352), the NRC amended the scope of the 
general licenses issued under 10 CFR 72.210 to include the storage of 
spent fuel in an independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSI) 
at power reactor sites to persons authorized to possess or operate 
nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR part 52. On February 16, 2011 (76 
FR 8872), the NRC amended subparts K and L in 10 CFR part 72, to extend 
and clarify the term limits for certificates of compliance and revised 
the conditions for spent fuel storage cask renewals, including adding 
requirements for the safety analysis report to include time-limited 
aging analyses and a description of aging management programs. The NRC 
also clarified the terminology used in the regulations to use 
``renewal'' rather than ``reapproval'' to better reflect that extending 
the term of a currently approved cask design is based on the cask 
design standards in effect at the time the certificate of compliance 
was approved rather than current standards.

IV. Discussion of Changes

    The term certified by the initial Certificate of Compliance No. 
1026 was 20 years. The period of extended operation for each cask 
begins 20 years after the cask is first used by the general licensee to 
store spent fuel. On November 6, 2020, Westinghouse Electric Company 
LLC submitted a request to the NRC to renew Certificate of Compliance 
No. 1026 for a period of 40 years beyond the initial certificate 
period. Westinghouse Electric Company LLC supplemented its request on 
March 30, 2021; June 30, 2022; and September 13, 2022.
    The FuelSolutions\TM\ Storage System (the system) is certified as 
described in the Safety Analysis Report (SAR) and in NRC's Safety 
Evaluation Report (SER) accompanying the certificate of compliance 
(CoC). The system consists of the following components: (1) canister 
for dry storage of spent nuclear fuel (W21 and W74); (2) transfer cask 
for canister loading, closure and handling capability (W100); and (3) 
storage cask which provides passive vertical dry storage of a loaded 
canister (W150). The system stores up to 21 pressurized water reactor 
(PWR) assemblies or 64 boiling water reactor (BWR) assemblies.
    The canister is the component providing confinement to the system 
for the stored fuel. A typical canister consists of a shell assembly, 
top and bottom inner closure plates, vent and drain port covers, 
internal basket assembly, top and bottom shield plugs, and top and 
bottom outer closure plates. All structural components are constructed 
of high-strength carbon steel (electroless nickel coated) or stainless 
steel. The canister shell, top and bottom inner closure plates, and the 
vent and drain port covers form the confinement boundary. The storage 
overpack provides structural support, shielding, protection from 
environmental conditions, and natural convection cooling of the 
canister during long-term storage. The transfer cask provides shielding 
during canister movements between the spent fuel pool and the storage 
cask.
    The Nuclear Energy Institute's (NEI) document NEI 14-03, Revision 
2, ``Format, Content and Implementation Guidance for Dry Cask Storage 
Operations-Based Aging Management,'' (December 2016) provides an 
operations-based, learning approach to aging management for the storage 
of spent fuel, which builds on the lessons learned from industry's 
experience with aging management for reactors. The NRC endorsed NEI 14-
03, Revision 2, with clarifications, in Regulatory Guide 3.76, Revision 
0, ``Implementation of Aging Management Requirements for Spent Fuel 
Storage Renewals,'' issued July 2021. Specifically, NEI 14-03 provides 
a framework for sharing operating experience through an industry-
developed database called the ISFSI Aging Management Institute of 
Nuclear Power Operations Database. NEI 14-03 also includes a framework 
for learning aging management programs using aging management 
``tollgates,'' which offer a structured approach for periodically 
assessing operating experience and data from applicable research and 
industry initiatives at specific times during the period of extended 
operation and performing a safety assessment that confirms the safe 
storage of the spent nuclear fuel by ensuring the aging management 
programs continue to effectively manage the identified aging effects. 
The ISFSI Aging Management Institute of Nuclear Power Operations 
Database provides operating experience information and a basis to 
support licensees' future changes to the aging management programs. The 
ISFSI Aging Management Institute of Nuclear Power Operations Database 
and the aging management tollgates are considered key elements in 
ensuring the effectiveness of aging management activities and the 
continued safe storage of spent fuel during the period of extended 
operation.
    Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC incorporated periodic tollgate 
assessments as requirements in the renewed certificate of compliance, 
as recommended in NEI 14-03, Revision 2. The implementation of tollgate 
assessments provides reasonable assurance that the aging management 
programs for the canister, the transfer cask, and the overpack will 
continue to effectively manage aging effects during the period of 
extended operation.
    The renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 
4 was conducted in accordance with the renewal provisions in Sec.  
72.240. The NRC's regulations require the safety analysis report for 
the renewal to include time-limited aging analyses that demonstrate 
that structures, systems, and components important to safety will 
continue to perform their intended function for the requested period of 
extended operation and a description of the aging management programs 
for the

[[Page 28575]]

management of issues associated with aging that could adversely affect 
structures, systems, and components important to safety. In addition, 
the regulations in Sec.  72.240(e) authorize the NRC to revise the 
certificate of compliance to include any additional terms, conditions, 
and specifications it deems necessary to ensure the safe operation of 
the cask during the certificate of compliance's renewal term.
    The NRC is revising the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 
through 4 to update the certificate holder name and address and to make 
corrections and editorial changes to the CoC and TSs. The changes to 
the aforementioned documents are identified with revision bars in the 
margin of each document. The NRC is adding three new conditions to 
address aging management activities related to the structures, systems, 
and components important to the safety of the dry storage system to 
ensure that these will maintain their intended functions during the 
period of extended storage operations. The three new conditions added 
to the renewal of the initial certificate of compliance and Amendment 
Nos. 1 through 4 are:
     A condition requiring the certificate of compliance holder 
to submit an updated final safety analysis report within 90 days after 
the effective date of the renewal. The updated final safety analysis 
report must reflect the changes resulting from the review and approval 
of the renewal of the certificate of compliance, including the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System final safety 
analysis report. This condition ensures that final safety analysis 
report changes are made in a timely fashion to enable general licensees 
using the storage system during the period of extended operation to 
develop and implement necessary procedures related to renewal and aging 
management activities. The certificate of compliance holder is required 
to continue to update the final safety analysis report pursuant to the 
requirements of Sec.  72.248.
     A condition requiring each general licensee using the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System design to 
include, in the evaluations required by Sec.  72.212(b)(5), evaluations 
related to the terms, conditions, and specifications of this 
certificate of compliance amendment as modified (i.e., changed or 
added) as a result of the renewal of the certificate of compliance and 
include, in the document review required by Sec.  72.212(b)(6), a 
review of the final safety analysis report changes resulting from the 
renewal of the certificate of compliance and the NRC Safety Evaluation 
Report for the renewal of the certificate of compliance. The general 
licensee would also be required to ensure that the evaluations required 
by Sec.  72.212(b)(7) in response to these changes are conducted and 
the determination required by Sec.  72.212(b)(8) is made. This 
condition also makes it clear that to meet the requirements in Sec.  
72.212(b)(11), general licensees that currently use a 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System will need to 
update their Sec.  72.212 reports, even if they do not put additional 
Westinghouse Electric Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel 
Management Systems into service after the renewal's effective date. 
These evaluations, reviews, and determinations are to be completed 
before the dry storage system enters the period of extended operation 
(which begins 20 years after the first use of the Westinghouse Electric 
Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System) or 
no later than 365 days after the effective date of this rule, whichever 
is later. This will provide general licensees a minimum of 365 days to 
comply with the new terms, conditions, specifications, and other 
changes to the certificate of compliance and to make the necessary 
determinations required by Sec.  72.212(b)(8) as to whether activities 
related to the storage of spent nuclear fuel using the renewed 
certificate of compliance involve a change in the facility Technical 
Specifications or requires a license amendment for the facility.
     A condition requiring all future amendments and revisions 
to the certificate of compliance (i.e., the initial certificate 1026 
and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4) include evaluations of the impacts to 
aging management activities (i.e., time-limited aging analyses and 
aging management programs) to ensure that they remain adequate for any 
changes to structures, systems, and components important to safety 
within the scope of renewal. This condition ensures that future 
amendments to the certificate of compliance address the renewed design 
bases for the certificate of compliance, including aging management 
impacts that may arise from any changes to the system in proposed 
future amendments.
    Additionally, the condition for the initial certificate and 
Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 would be amended to reflect changes to the 
scope of the general license granted by Sec.  72.210 that were made 
after the approval of the initial certificate. The authorization is 
amended to allow persons authorized to possess or operate a nuclear 
power reactor under 10 CFR part 52 to use the Westinghouse Electric 
Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System 
under the general license issued under Sec.  72.210.
    The NRC made one corresponding change from the technical 
specifications for the initial certificate of compliance and Amendment 
Nos. 1 through 4 by adding a section addressing the aging management 
program. General licensees using the FuelSolutionsTM Spent 
Fuel Management System design during the period of extended operation 
will need to establish, implement, and maintain written procedures for 
each applicable aging management program in the final safety analysis 
report to use the FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management 
System design during the approved period of extended operation. The 
procedures will need to include provisions for changing aging 
management program elements, as necessary, and within the limitations 
of the approved design bases to address new information on aging 
effects based on inspection findings and/or industry operating 
experience. General licensees will also be required to perform tollgate 
assessments as described in the final safety analysis report.
    General licensees will need to establish and implement these 
written procedures prior to entering the period of extended operation 
(which begins 20 years after the first use of the cask system) or no 
later than 365 days after the effective date of this rule, whichever is 
later. The general licensee is required to maintain these written 
procedures for as long as the general licensee continues to operate the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System in service for 
longer than 20 years.
    Under Sec.  72.240(d), the design of a spent fuel storage cask will 
be renewed if (1) the quality assurance requirements in 10 CFR part 72, 
subpart G, ``Quality Assurance,'' are met, (2) the requirements of 
Sec.  72.236(a) through (i) are met, and (3) the application includes a 
demonstration that the storage of spent fuel has not, in a significant 
manner, adversely affected the structures, systems, and components 
important to safety. Additionally, Sec.  72.240(c) requires that the 
safety analysis report accompanying the application contain time-
limited aging analyses that demonstrate that the structures, systems, 
and components important to safety will continue to perform their 
intended function for the requested period of extended operation and a 
description of the aging management program for management of aging 
issues that could adversely affect structures,

[[Page 28576]]

systems, and components important to safety.
    As documented in the preliminary safety evaluation report, the NRC 
reviewed the application for the renewal of the certificate of 
compliance and the conditions in the certificate of compliance and 
determined that the conditions in subpart G, Sec.  72.236(a) through 
(i), have been met and the application includes a demonstration that 
the storage of spent nuclear fuel has not, in a significant manner, 
adversely affected structures, systems, and components important to 
safety. The NRC's safety review determined that the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System, with the added 
terms, conditions, and specifications in the certificate of compliance 
and the technical specifications, will continue to meet the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 72 for an additional 40 years beyond the 
initial certificate term. Consistent with Sec.  72.240, the NRC is 
renewing the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System initial 
certificate 1026 and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4.
    Extending the expiration date of the approval for the initial 
certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 for 40 years and requiring 
the implementation of aging management activities during the period of 
extended operation does not impose any modification or addition to the 
design of a cask system's structures, systems, and components important 
to safety, or to the procedures or organization required to operate the 
system during the initial 20-year storage term certified by the cask's 
initial certificate of compliance. General licensees who have loaded 
these casks, or who load these casks in the future under the 
specifications of the applicable renewed certificate of compliance, may 
store spent fuel in these cask system designs for 20 years without 
implementing the aging management program. For any casks that have been 
in use for more than 20 years, the general licensee will have 365 days 
to complete the analyses required to use the cask system design 
pursuant to the terms and conditions in the renewed certificate of 
compliance. As explained in the 2011 final rule that amended 10 CFR 
part 72 (76 FR 8872), the general licensee's authority to use a 
particular storage cask design under an approved certificate of 
compliance will be for at least the term certified by the cask's 
certificate of compliance. For casks placed into service before the 
expiration date of the initial certificate, the general licensee's 
authority to use the cask would be extended for an additional 40 years 
from the date the initial certificate expired. For casks placed into 
service after the expiration date of the initial certificate and before 
the effective date of this rule, the general licensee's authority to 
use the cask would last the length of the term certified by the cask's 
certificate of compliance (i.e., 40 years after the cask is placed into 
service). For casks placed into service after this rule becomes 
effective, the general licensee's authority to use the cask would 
expire 40 years after the cask is first placed into service.
    This direct final rule revises the FuelSolutionsTM Spent 
Fuel Management System design listing in Sec.  72.214 by renewing, for 
40 more years, the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 
of Certificate of Compliance No. 1026. The renewed certificate of 
compliance includes the changes to the certificate of compliance and 
technical specifications previously described. The renewed certificate 
of compliance includes the terms, conditions, and specifications that 
will ensure the safe operation of the cask during the renewal term and 
the added conditions that will require the implementation of an aging 
management program. The preliminary safety evaluation report describes 
the new and revised conditions in the certificate of compliance, the 
changes to the technical specifications, and the NRC staff evaluation.

V. Voluntary Consensus Standards

    The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (Pub. 
L. 104-113) requires that Federal agencies use technical standards that 
are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies unless 
the use of such a standard is inconsistent with applicable law or 
otherwise impractical. In this direct final rule, the NRC revises the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System Cask System 
design listed in Sec.  72.214, ``List of approved spent fuel storage 
casks.'' This action does not constitute the establishment of a 
standard that contains generally applicable requirements.

VI. Agreement State Compatibility

    Under the ``Agreement State Program Policy Statement'' approved by 
the Commission on October 2, 2017, and published in the Federal 
Register on October 18, 2017 (82 FR 48535), this rule is classified as 
Compatibility Category NRC--Areas of Exclusive NRC Regulatory 
Authority. The NRC program elements in this category are those that 
relate directly to areas of regulation reserved to the NRC by the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the provisions of 10 CFR 
chapter I. Therefore, compatibility is not required for program 
elements in this category.

VII. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885).

VIII. Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact

    Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 
and the NRC's regulations in 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection 
Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions,'' 
the NRC has determined that this direct final rule, if adopted, would 
not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of 
the human environment and, therefore, an environmental impact statement 
is not required. The NRC has made a finding of no significant impact 
based on this environmental assessment.

A. The Action

    The action is to amend Sec.  72.214 to revise the Westinghouse 
Electric Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management 
System listing within the ``List of approved spent fuel storage casks'' 
to renew the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 to 
Certificate of Compliance No. 1026.

B. The Need for the Action

    This direct final rule renews the certificate of compliance for the 
Westinghouse Electric Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel 
Management System design within the list of approved spent fuel storage 
casks to allow power reactor licensees to store spent fuel at reactor 
sites in casks with the approved modifications under a general license. 
Specifically, this rule extends the expiration date for the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System certificate of 
compliance for an additional 40 years, allowing a power reactor 
licensee to continue using the cask design during a period of extended 
operation for a term certified by the cask's renewed certificate of 
compliance.
    In addition, this direct final rule revises the certificate of 
compliance for the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 
to update the

[[Page 28577]]

certificate holder name and address and adds three new conditions:
     A condition for submitting an updated FSAR to the NRC, in 
accordance with Sec.  72.4, within 90 days after the effective date of 
the CoC renewal.
     A condition for renewed CoC use during the period of 
extended operation to ensure that a general licensee's report prepared 
under Sec.  72.212 evaluates the appropriate considerations for the 
period of extended operation. All future amendments and revisions to 
this CoC must include evaluations of the impacts to aging management 
activities. The NRC is revising the initial certificate and Amendment 
Nos. 1 through 4 to address the language change in Sec.  72.210 
``General license issue'' and other updates to the regulations. The NRC 
is making changes to TSs including updating the certificate holder's 
information in all TSs for the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 
through 4 and updating references to ``FuelSolutions'' and 
``Westinghouse Electric Company LLC'' or ``WEC.''
     A condition requiring all future amendments and revisions 
to the certificate of compliance (i.e., the initial certificate 1026 
and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4) include evaluations of the impacts to 
aging management activities (i.e., time-limited aging analyses and 
aging management programs) to ensure that they remain adequate for any 
changes to structures, systems, and components important to safety 
within the scope of renewal.
    Finally, the NRC will make various corrections and editorial 
changes to the CoC and TSs.

C. Environmental Impacts of the Action

    On July 18,1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 
CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general 
license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The potential 
environmental impact of using NRC-approved storage casks was analyzed 
in the environmental assessment for the 1990 final rule and are 
described in ``Environmental Assessment for Proposed Rule Entitled, 
`Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel in NRC-Approved Storage Casks at Nuclear 
Power Reactor Sites.' '' The potential environmental impacts for the 
longer-term use of dry cask designs and the renewal of certificates of 
compliance were analyzed in the environmental assessment for the 2011 
final rule establishing the regulatory requirements for renewing 
certificates of compliance and are described in ``Environmental 
Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact for the Final Rule 
Amending 10 CFR part 72 License and Certificate of Compliance Terms.'' 
The environmental impacts from continued storage were also considered 
in NUREG-2157, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for Continued 
Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel.'' The environmental assessment for the 
initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 to Certificate of 
Compliance No. 1026 tiers off the environmental assessment for the 
February 16, 2011, final rule and NUREG-2157. Tiering on past 
environmental assessments is a standard process under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
    The Westinghouse Electric Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM 
Spent Fuel Management System is designed to mitigate the effects of 
design basis accidents that could occur during storage. Design basis 
accidents account for human-induced events and the most severe natural 
phenomena reported for the site and surrounding area. Postulated 
accidents analyzed for an independent spent fuel storage installation, 
the type of facility at which a holder of a power reactor operating 
license would store spent fuel in casks in accordance with 10 CFR part 
72, can include tornado winds and tornado-generated missiles, a design 
basis earthquake, a design basis flood, an accidental cask drop, 
lightning effects, fire, explosions, and other incidents.
    A renewal reaffirms the original design basis and allows the cask 
to be used during a period of extended operation that corresponds to 
the term certified by the cask's certificate of compliance in the 
renewal. As a condition of the renewal, the NRC requires an aging 
management program that will ensure that structures, systems, and 
components important to safety will perform as designers intended 
during the renewal period. The renewal does not reflect a change in 
design or fabrication of the cask system. This renewal does not reflect 
a significant change in design or fabrication of the cask. Because 
there are no significant design or process changes, any resulting 
occupational exposure or offsite dose rates from the renewal of the 
initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 would remain well 
within the 10 CFR part 20 limits. The NRC has also determined that the 
design of the cask would continue to maintain confinement, shielding, 
and criticality control in the event of an accident. Therefore, these 
changes will not result in any radiological or non-radiological 
environmental impacts that significantly differ from the environmental 
impacts evaluated in the environmental assessment supporting the 
February 16, 2011, final rule. There will be no significant change in 
the types or significant revisions in the amounts of any effluent 
released, no significant increase in the individual or cumulative 
radiation exposures, and no significant increase in the potential for, 
or consequences from, radiological accidents. The NRC determined that 
the structures, systems, and components important to safety will 
continue to perform their intended functions during the requested 
period of extended operation. The NRC determined that the renewed 
Westinghouse Electric Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel 
Management System design, when used under the conditions specified in 
the renewed certificate of compliance, the technical specifications, 
and the NRC's regulations, will meet the requirements of 10 CFR part 
72; therefore, adequate protection of public health and safety will 
continue to be reasonably assured. The NRC documented its safety 
findings in the preliminary safety evaluation report.

D. Alternative to the Action

    The alternative to this action is to deny the renewal of the 
initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 and not issue the 
direct final rule. Consequently, any 10 CFR part 72 general licensee 
that seeks to load spent nuclear fuel into Westinghouse Electric 
Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System 
after the expiration date of the certificate of compliance or that 
seeks to continue storing spent nuclear fuel in the Westinghouse 
Electric Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management 
System for longer than the term certified by the cask's certificate of 
compliance for the initial certificate (i.e., more than 20 years) would 
have to request an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  72.212 
and 72.214 or would have to load the spent nuclear fuel into a 
different approved cask design. Under this alternative, those licensees 
interested in continuing to use the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System would have to 
prepare, and the NRC would have to review, a separate exemption 
request, thereby increasing the administrative burden upon the NRC and 
the costs to each licensee. If the general licensee is granted an 
exemption, the environmental impacts would be the same as the proposed 
action. If the general licensee is not granted an exemption, the 
general licensee would need to unload the Westinghouse Electric Company 
LLC FuelSolutionsTM

[[Page 28578]]

Spent Fuel Management System and load the fuel into another cask system 
design, which would result in environmental impacts that are greater 
than for the proposed action because activities associated with cask 
loading and decontamination may result in some small liquid and gaseous 
effluent.

E. Alternative Use of Resources

    Renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 
to Certificate of Compliance No. 1026 would result in no irreversible 
commitment of resources.

F. Agencies and Persons Contacted

    No agencies or persons outside the NRC were contacted in connection 
with the preparation of this environmental assessment.

G. Finding of No Significant Impact

    This direct final rule is to amend Sec.  72.214 to revise the 
Westinghouse Electric Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel 
Management System listing within the ``List of approved spent fuel 
storage casks'' to renew, for an additional 40 years, the initial 
certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 of Certificate of Compliance 
No. 1026. The environmental impacts of the action have been reviewed 
under the requirements in the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969, as amended, and the NRC's regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 
51, ``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions.'' The renewal does not reflect a change 
in design or fabrication of the cask system as approved for the initial 
certificate or Amendment Nos. 1 through 4. The NRC determined that the 
renewed Westinghouse Electric Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM 
Spent Fuel Management System design, when used under the conditions 
specified in the renewed certificate of compliance, the technical 
specifications, and the NRC's regulations, will meet the requirements 
of 10 CFR part 72; therefore, adequate protection of public health and 
safety will continue to be reasonably assured.
    Based on the foregoing environmental assessment, the NRC concludes 
that this direct final rule, ``List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage 
Casks: FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System, 
Certificate of Compliance No. 1026, Renewal of Initial Certificate and 
Amendment Nos. 1 through 4,'' will not have a significant effect on the 
quality of the human environment. Therefore, the NRC has determined 
that an environmental impact statement is not necessary for this direct 
final rule.

IX. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement

    This direct final rule does not contain any new or amended 
collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing collections of information were 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150-
0132.

Public Protection Notification

    The NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a request for information or an information collection 
requirement unless the requesting document displays a currently valid 
Office of Management and Budget control number.

X. Regulatory Flexibility Certification

    Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the 
NRC certifies that this direct final rule will not, if issued, have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
This direct final rule affects only nuclear power plant licensees and 
Westinghouse Electric Company LLC. These entities do not fall within 
the scope of the definition of small entities set forth in the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act or the size standards established by the NRC 
(Sec.  2.810).

XI. Regulatory Analysis

    On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 
CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent nuclear fuel under a 
general license in cask designs approved by the NRC. Any nuclear power 
reactor licensee can use NRC-approved cask designs to store spent 
nuclear fuel if (1) it notifies the NRC in advance; (2) the spent fuel 
is stored under the conditions specified in the cask's certificate of 
compliance; and (3) the conditions of the general license are met. A 
list of NRC-approved cask designs is contained in Sec.  72.214. On 
January 16, 2001 (66 FR 3444), the NRC issued an amendment to 10 CFR 
part 72 that approved the FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel 
Management System by adding it to the list of NRC-approved cask designs 
in Sec.  72.214.
    On November 6, 2020, and as supplemented on March 30, 2021, June 
30, 2022, and September 13, 2022, Westinghouse Electric Company LLC 
submitted a request to renew the FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel 
Management System as described in Section IV, ``Discussion of 
Changes,'' of this document.
    The alternative to this action is to withhold approval of the 
renewal of the initial certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 and 
to require any 10 CFR part 72 general licensee seeking to continue the 
storage of spent nuclear fuel in Westinghouse Electric Company LLC 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System using the 
initial certificate or Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 beyond the initial 
20-year storage term certified by the cask's initial certificate of 
compliance to request an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  
72.212 and 72.214. The term for general licenses would not be extended 
from 20 years to 40 years. Under this alternative, each interested 10 
CFR part 72 licensee would have to prepare, and the NRC would have to 
review, a separate exemption request, thereby increasing the 
administrative burden upon the NRC and the costs to each licensee.
    Approval of this direct final rule is consistent with previous NRC 
actions. Further, as documented in the preliminary safety evaluation 
report and environmental assessment, this direct final rule will have 
no adverse effect on public health and safety or the environment. This 
direct final rule has no significant identifiable impact or benefit on 
other government agencies. Based on this regulatory analysis, the NRC 
concludes that the requirements of this direct final rule are 
commensurate with the NRC's responsibilities for public health and 
safety and the common defense and security. No other available 
alternative is believed to be as satisfactory; therefore, this action 
is recommended.

XII. Backfitting and Issue Finality

    The NRC has determined that the actions in this direct final rule 
do not require a backfit analysis because they do not fall within the 
definition of backfitting under Sec.  72.62 or Sec.  50.109(a)(1), they 
do not impact the issue finality provisions applicable to combined 
licenses under 10 CFR part 52, and they do not impact general licensees 
that are using these systems for the duration of their current general 
licenses.
    Certificate of Compliance No. 1026 for the Westinghouse Electric 
Company LLC FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System 
design, as currently listed in Sec.  72.214, ``List of Approved Spent 
Fuel Storage Casks,'' was initially approved for a 20-year term. This 
direct final rule would renew the initial certificate and Amendment 
Nos. 1 through 4, extending their

[[Page 28579]]

approval period by 40 years. The term certified by the cask's 
certificate of compliance for a renewed certificate of compliance is 
the period of time commencing with the most recent certificate of 
compliance renewal date and ending with the certificate of compliance 
expiration date. With this renewal, the term certified by the cask's 
certificate of compliance would change from 20 years to 60 years, with 
the period of extended operation beginning 20 years after the cask is 
placed into service. The revision to the certificate of compliance 
through the renewal consists of the changes in the renewed initial 
certificate (Amendment No. 0) and renewed Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 as 
previously described, and as set forth in the renewed certificates of 
compliance and technical specifications. These changes would not affect 
the use of the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System design for the 
initial 20- year term for previously loaded casks. The renewed 
certificates would require implementation of aging management programs 
during the period of extended operation, which begins after the storage 
cask system's initial 20-year service period.
    Because the term for the renewal would be longer than the initial 
term certified by the cask's certificate of compliance, the general 
licensee's authority to use the cask would be extended and would be no 
less than 60 years. This change would not add, eliminate, or modify (1) 
structures, systems, or components of an independent spent fuel storage 
installation or a monitored retrievable storage installation or (2) the 
procedures or organization required to operate an independent spent 
fuel storage installation or a monitored retrievable storage 
installation.
    Renewing these certificates does not fall within the definition of 
backfit under Sec.  72.62 or Sec.  50.109, or otherwise represent an 
inconsistency with the issue finality provisions applicable to combined 
licenses in 10 CFR part 52. General licensees who have loaded these 
casks, or who load these casks in the future under the specifications 
of the applicable certificate, may continue to store spent fuel in 
these systems for the initial 20-year storage period authorized by the 
original certificate. Extending the certificates' expiration dates for 
40 more years and requiring the implementation of aging management 
programs does not impose any modification or addition to the design of 
the structures, systems, and components important to safety of a cask 
system, or to the procedures or organization required to operate the 
system during this initial 20-year term certified by the cask's 
certificate of compliance. The aging management programs required to be 
implemented by this renewal are only required to be implemented after 
the storage cask system's initial 20-year service period ends.
    Because this rulemaking renews the certificates, and because 
renewal is a separate NRC licensing action voluntarily implemented by 
vendors or licensees, the renewal of these certificates is not an 
imposition of new or changed requirements from which these certificate 
of compliance holders or licensees would otherwise be protected by the 
backfitting provisions in Sec.  72.62 or Sec.  50.109. Even if renewal 
of this certificate of compliance cask system design could be 
considered a backfit, Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, as the 
certificate of compliance holder and vendor of the casks, is not 
protected by the backfitting provisions in Sec.  72.62 in this 
capacity.
    Unlike a vendor, general licensees using the existing systems 
subject to these renewals would be protected by the backfitting 
provisions in Sec.  72.62 and Sec.  50.109 if the renewals constituted 
new or changed requirements. But as previously explained, renewal of 
the certificates for these systems does not impose such requirements. 
The general licensees using these certificates of compliance may 
continue storing material in the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System design for the 
initial 20-year storage period identified in the applicable certificate 
or amendment with no changes. If general licensees choose to continue 
to store spent fuel in the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System design after 
the initial 20-year period, these general licensees will be required to 
implement the applicable aging management programs for any cask systems 
subject to a renewed certificate of compliance, but such continued use 
is voluntary.
    Additionally, the actions in this direct final rule do not impact 
issue finality provisions applicable to combined licenses under 10 CFR 
part 52. For these reasons, renewing the initial certificate and 
Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 of Certificate of Compliance No. 1026 does 
not constitute backfitting under Sec.  72.62 or Sec.  50.109(a)(1), or 
otherwise represent an inconsistency with the issue finality provisions 
applicable to combined licenses in 10 CFR part 52. Accordingly, the NRC 
has not prepared a backfit analysis for this rulemaking.

List of Approved Spent Fuel Storage Casks: FuelSolutionsTM Spent 
Fuel Management System, Certificate of Compliance No. 1026, Renewal of 
Initial Certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 Through 4

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to 
amend its spent fuel regulations by

[[Page 28688]]

revising the Westinghouse Electric Company LLC 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System listing within 
the ``List of approved spent fuel storage casks'' to renew the initial 
certificate and Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 to Certificate of Compliance 
No. 1026. The renewal of the initial certificate of compliance and 
Amendment Nos. 1 through 4 for 40 years would revise the certificate's 
conditions and technical specifications to address aging management 
activities related to the structures, systems, and components important 
to safety of the dry storage system to ensure that these will maintain 
their intended functions during the period of extended storage 
operations.

DATES: Submit comments by May 20, 2024. Comments received after this 
date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the NRC is 
able to ensure consideration only for comments received on or before 
this date.

ADDRESSES: Submit your comments, identified by Docket ID NRC-2023-0220,

II. Rulemaking Procedure

    Because the NRC considers this action to be non-controversial, the 
NRC is publishing this proposed rule concurrently with a direct final 
rule in the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal 
Register. The direct final rule will become effective on July 3, 2024. 
However, if the NRC receives any significant adverse comment by May 20, 
2024, then the NRC will publish a document that withdraws the direct 
final rule. If the direct final rule is withdrawn, the NRC will address 
the comments in a subsequent final rule. In general, absent significant 
modifications to the proposed revisions requiring republication, the 
NRC will not initiate a second comment period on this action in the 
event the direct final rule is withdrawn.
    A significant adverse comment is a comment where the commenter 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including challenges to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. A comment is adverse and significant if:
    (1) The comment opposes the rule and provides a reason sufficient 
to require a substantive response in a notice-and-comment process. For 
example, a substantive response is required when:
    (a) The comment causes the NRC to reevaluate (or reconsider) its 
position or conduct additional analysis;
    (b) The comment raises an issue serious enough to warrant a 
substantive response to clarify or complete the record; or
    (c) The comment raises a relevant issue that was not previously 
addressed or considered by the NRC.
    (2) The comment proposes a change or an addition to the rule, and 
it is apparent that the rule would be ineffective or unacceptable 
without incorporation of the change or addition.
    (3) The comment causes the NRC to make a change (other than 
editorial) to the rule, certificate of compliance, or technical 
specifications (TS).
    For a more detailed discussion of the proposed rule changes and 
associated analyses, see the direct final rule published in the Rules 
and Regulations section of this issue of the Federal Register.

[[Page 28689]]

III. Background

    Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, 
requires that ``[t]he Secretary [of the Department of Energy] shall 
establish a demonstration program, in cooperation with the private 
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear 
power reactor sites, with the objective of establishing one or more 
technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, 
approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional 
site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section 133 of the Nuclear 
Waste Policy Act states, in part, that ``[t]he Commission shall, by 
rule, establish procedures for the licensing of any technology approved 
by the Commission under Section 219(a) [sic: 218(a)] for use at the 
site of any civilian nuclear power reactor.''
    To implement this mandate, the Commission approved dry storage of 
spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks under a general license by 
publishing a final rule that added a new subpart K in part 72 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) entitled ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites'' (55 FR 
29181; July 18, 1990). This rule also established a new subpart L in 10 
CFR part 72 entitled ``Approval of Spent Fuel Storage Casks,'' which 
contains procedures and criteria for obtaining NRC approval of spent 
fuel storage cask designs. The NRC subsequently issued a final rule on 
January 16, 2001 (66 FR 3444), that approved the 
FuelSolutionsTM Spent Fuel Management System design and 
added it to the list of NRC-approved cask designs in Sec.  72.214 as 
Certificate of Compliance No.1026.
    On August 28, 2007 (72 FR 49352), the NRC amended the scope of the 
general licenses issued under 10 CFR 72.210 to include the storage of 
spent fuel in an independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSI) 
at power reactor sites to persons authorized to possess or operate 
nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR part 52. On February 16, 2011 (76 
FR 8872), the NRC amended subparts K and L in 10 CFR part 72, to extend 
and clarify the term limits for certificates of compliance and revised 
the conditions for spent fuel storage cask renewals, including adding 
requirements for the safety analysis report to include time-limited 
aging analyses and a description of aging management programs. The NRC 
also clarified the terminology used in the regulations to use 
``renewal'' rather than ``reapproval'' to better reflect that extending 
the term of a currently approved cask design is based on the cask 
design standards in effect at the time the certificate of compliance 
was approved rather than current standards.

IV. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885). The NRC requests comment on the proposed rule with respect to 
clarity and effectiveness of the language used.

Attachment--Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalty of $17,500

United States of America

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

In the Matter of: Almonte Geo Service Group, Toa Alta, Puerto Rico, 
Docket No. 03038488, License No. 52-31453-01, EA-23-016

Order Imposing Civil Monetary Penalty

I

    Almonte Geo Service Group (Licensee) is the holder of Nuclear 
Materials License No. 52-31453-01 issued on October 4, 2011, by the 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to Part 
30 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR). The license 
authorizes the possession and use of radioactive sources contained in 
portable nuclear moisture density gauges in accordance with conditions 
specified therein. The facility is located on the Licensee's site in 
Toa Alta, Puerto Rico.

II

    The NRC inspected the Licensee's activities between March 1, 2023, 
and June 14, 2023. The results of this inspection indicated that the 
Licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC 
requirements. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of 
Civil Penalty (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by letter dated 
November 9, 2023 (ML23310A012).\1\ The Notice states the nature of the 
violation, the provision of the NRC's requirements that the Licensee 
violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the 
violation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Designation in parentheses refers to an Agency-wide 
Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) accession number. 
Documents referenced in this letter are publicly-available using the 
accession number in ADAMS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Namely, the Notice describes that the Licensee failed to complete 
decommissioning no later than 24 months following the initiation of 
decommissioning as required by 10 CFR 30.36(h). In particular, the 
Licensee has not disposed of or transferred its licensed material 
despite having had its license revoked more than seven years ago and 
having initiated decommissioning activities almost four years ago. The 
Notice also documents that the NRC's primary interest in this matter is 
ensuring that the Licensee meets its obligation to transfer or dispose 
of the licensed material in its

[[Page 28819]]

possession and complete decommissioning of its site. Therefore, the 
civil penalty would not have been imposed if the Licensee (1) had 
properly disposed of or transferred the remaining sealed radioactive 
source possessed under the NRC license and (2) had sent information 
documenting that the material had been transferred or disposed of to 
the NRC within 60 days of the date of the letter transmitting the 
Notice (i.e., by January 8, 2024).
    The Licensee responded to the Notice in an email dated December 9, 
2023 (ML23345A099). In its response, the Licensee requested additional 
time to save money to pay for proper disposal of the remaining sealed 
radioactive source in its possession. As of the date of this Order, the 
Licensee remains in possession of the sealed radioactive source.

III

    After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements 
of fact, explanation, and argument for mitigation contained therein, 
the NRC staff has determined that the violation occurred as stated and 
that the penalty proposed for the violation designated in the Notice 
should be imposed.

IV

    In view of the foregoing and pursuant to Section 234 of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282, and 10 CFR 2.205, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
    The Licensee shall pay the civil penalty in the amount of $17,500 
within 30 days of the date of the publication of this Order in the 
Federal Register through one of the following two methods:
    1. Submit the payment with the enclosed invoice to this Order (EA-
23-016) to the following address: Office of the Chief Financial 
Officer, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, P.O. Box 979051, St. 
Louis, MO 63197 or,
    2. Submit the payment in accordance with NUREG/BR-0254.
    In addition, at the time payment is made, the Licensee shall submit 
a statement indicating when and by what method payment was made, to the 
Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
One White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-2738.

V

    In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, the Licensee must, and any other 
person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an answer to this 
Order within 30 days of its publication in the Federal Register. In 
addition, the Licensee and any other person adversely affected by this 
Order may request a hearing on this Order within 30 days of its 
publication in the Federal Register. Where good cause is shown, 
consideration will be given to extending the time to answer or request 
a hearing. A request for extension of time must be directed to the 
Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
and include a statement of good cause for the extension.
    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected] or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system timestamps the document and sends the 
submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where

[[Page 28820]]

you will be able to access any publicly available documents in a 
particular hearing docket. Participants are requested not to include 
personal privacy information such as social security numbers, home 
addresses, or personal phone numbers in their filings unless an NRC 
regulation or other law requires submission of such information. With 
respect to copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve 
the purpose of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute Fair Use 
applications, participants should not include copyrighted materials in 
their submission.
    If a person other than the Licensee requests a hearing, that person 
shall set forth with particularity the manner in which their interest 
is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set 
forth in 10 CFR 2.309(d) and (f).
    If a hearing is requested by a licensee or a person whose interest 
is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an order designating 
the time and place of any hearings. If a hearing is held, the issue to 
be considered at such hearing shall be whether this Order should be 
sustained. In the absence of any request for hearing, or written 
approval of an extension of time in which to request a hearing, the 
provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from 
the date this Order is published in the Federal Register without 
further order or proceedings.
    If an extension of time for requesting a hearing has been approved, 
the provisions specified in Section IV shall be final when the 
extension expires if a hearing request has not been received. If 
payment has not been made by the time specified above, the matter may 
be referred to the Attorney General, for collection.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC has received an application from CEG, dated February 14, 
2024 (ADAMS Package Accession No. ML24045A023), filed pursuant to 
section 103 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and 
part 54 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
``Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Power 
Plants,'' to renew the CPS operating license for an additional period 
of 20 years. Clinton Power Station, Unit 1 is a boiling water reactor 
licensed to operate at 3,473 megawatts thermal, and is located near 
Clinton, Illinois. A notice of receipt of the license renewal 
application (LRA) was published in the Federal Register on March 7, 
2024 (89 FR 16591).
    The NRC staff has determined that CEG submitted sufficient 
information in accordance with 10 CFR 54.19, 54.21, 54.22, 54.23, 
51.45, and 51.53(c), to enable the staff to undertake a review of the 
application, and that the application is, therefore, acceptable for 
docketing. The current Docket No. 50-461 for Facility Operating License 
No. NPF-62 will be retained. The determination to accept the LRA for 
docketing does not constitute a determination that a renewed operating 
license should be issued and does not preclude the NRC staff from 
requesting additional information as the review proceeds.
    Before issuance of the requested renewed license, the NRC will have 
made the findings required by the Act and the Commission's rules and 
regulations. In accordance with 10 CFR 54.29, the NRC may issue a 
renewed license on the basis of its review if it finds that actions 
have been identified and have been or will be taken with respect to: 
(1) managing the effects of aging during the period of extended 
operation on the functionality of structures and components that have 
been identified as requiring aging management review; and (2) time-
limited aging analyses that have been identified as requiring review, 
such that there is reasonable assurance that the activities authorized 
by the renewed licenses will continue to be conducted in accordance 
with the current licensing basis and that any changes made to the 
plant's current licensing basis will comply with the Act and the 
Commission's regulations.
    Additionally, in accordance with 10 CFR 51.95(c), the NRC will 
prepare an environmental impact statement as a supplement to the 
Commission's NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for 
License Renewal of Nuclear Plants,'' dated June 2013 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML13106A241). In considering the LRA, the Commission must find that 
the applicable requirements of subpart A of 10 CFR part 51 have been 
satisfied, and that any matters raised under 10 CFR 2.335 have been 
addressed. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.26, and as part of the environmental 
scoping process, the staff intends to hold public scoping meetings. 
Detailed information regarding the environmental scoping meetings will 
be the subject of a separate Federal Register notice.

II. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding 
officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a 
hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this

[[Page 27806]]

document. Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended 
contentions that are filed after the deadline will not be entertained 
absent a determination by the presiding officer that the filing 
demonstrates good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 
2.309(c)(1)(i) through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

III. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
request to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket is created, the participant must submit 
adjudicatory documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on 
submissions is available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is 
considered complete at the time the document is submitted through the 
NRC's E-Filing system. To be timely, an electronic filing must be 
submitted to the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due 
date. Upon receipt of a transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps 
the document and sends the submitter an email confirming receipt of the 
document. The E-Filing system also distributes an email that provides 
access to the document to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and 
any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish 
to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the 
document on those participants separately. Therefore, applicants and 
other participants (or their counsel or representative) must apply for 
and receive a digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are 
filed to obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    Information about the license renewal process can be found under 
the Nuclear Reactors icon at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal.html on the NRC's public website. Copies of the 
application to renew the operating licenses for CPS are available for 
public inspection at the NRC's PDR, and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications.html. The application may be accessed in ADAMS through the 
NRC Library on the internet at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html under ADAMS Accession No. ML24045A023. As previously stated 
in this notice, persons who do not have access to ADAMS or who 
encounter problems in accessing the documents located in ADAMS may 
contact the NRC's PDR reference staff by telephone at 1-800-397-4209 or 
301-415-4737, or by email to [email protected].

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a proposed collection of 
information to OMB for review entitled ``Pre-Application Communication 
and Scheduling for Licensing Actions Related to Digital Instrumentation 
and Controls.'' The NRC hereby informs potential respondents that an 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and that a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on December 5, 2023, 88 FR 84365.
    1. The title of the information collection: Pre-Application 
Communication and Scheduling for Licensing Actions Related to Digital 
Instrumentation and Controls.
    2. OMB approval number: An OMB control Number has not yet been 
assigned to this proposed information collection.
    3. Type of submission: New.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Annually, 
with the addition of voluntary updates as available.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: All holders of 
operating licenses or combined licenses for nuclear power reactors, 
except those that have permanently ceased operations and have certified 
that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel or 
combined license holders that have not received authorization to load 
nuclear fuel and begin operation.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 4.33.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 4.33.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 867.
    10. Abstract: Operating reactors in the U.S. want to more 
efficiently integrate and implement digital upgrades into plant systems 
to address obsolescence issues with analog components and improve 
overall plant reliability. The regulatory focus for digital systems is 
tailored to the unique nature of the digital technologies and uses 
proposed by licensees and applicants. Depending on the scope of an 
analog to digital or a digital-to-digital upgrade, the level-of-effort 
for a requested licensing actions (e.g., license amendment, exemption) 
can be significantly higher than the level-of-effort expended on a 
routine requested licensing action. Additionally, a significant portion 
of the level-of-effort for a digital instrumentation and controls (I&C) 
review will require specialized digital I&C and human factors 
engineering skills. To better plan and ensure availability of resources 
to perform digital I&C reviews, the NRC is seeking scheduling 
information for licensing submittals from all respondents. This 
information will allow the NRC to better allocate its resources to 
support the activities associated with licensing these technologies 
while being better able to meet the licensee's desired timeline.

II. Discussion

    NUREG-1022, Revision 3, ``Event Reporting Guidelines: 10 CFR 50.72 
and 50.73,'' issued January 2013 (ADAMS Accession No. ML13032A220), 
contains guidelines that the staff of the NRC considers acceptable for 
use in meeting the reporting requirements in section 50.72 of title 10 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Immediate notification 
requirements for operating nuclear power reactors,'' and 10 CFR 50.73, 
``Licensee event report system.'' In August 2018, the Nuclear Energy 
Institute submitted a petition for rulemaking to amend 10 CFR 50.72 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML18247A204). In 2021, the Commission directed the 
NRC staff to pursue the rulemaking (ADAMS Accession No. ML21209A953). 
As part of this rulemaking effort, the NRC determined that 
clarifications to the guidance in section 3.2.4, ``Degraded or 
Unanalyzed Condition,'' of NUREG 1022, Revision 3, could address part 
of the concerns identified in the petition.
    In developing Supplement 2 to NUREG-1022, Revision 3, the NRC 
evaluated data on submitted and retracted events and held a public 
meeting on August 9, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23270B927), to discuss 
section 3.2.4 of NUREG-1022 with stakeholders. Supplement 2 would 
provide updated guidance for nuclear power reactor licensees and could 
be used for evaluating and reporting degraded or unanalyzed conditions 
as described in10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii). The 
specific guidance included in Supplement 2, once final, will supersede 
the guidance found in section 3.2.4 of NUREG-1022, Revision 3.

III. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of NUREG-1022, Revision 3, Supplement 2, if finalized, 
would not constitute backfitting as defined in 10 CFR 50.109, 
``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC Management Directive (MD) 8.4, 
``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and 
Information Requests''; affect issue finality of any approval issued 
under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certificates, and Approvals for 
Nuclear Power Plants''; or constitute forward fitting as defined in MD 
8.4, because licensees would not be required to comply with the 
guidance in Supplement 2.

IV. Public Comments

    This document requests comments from interested members of the 
public by June 17, 2024. After evaluating the comments received, the 
staff will either reconsider the proposed change or announce the 
availability of the change in a subsequent document published in the 
Federal Register (perhaps with some changes as a result of public 
comments).

    Dated: April 12, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is reviewing an exemption request from TVA, dated February 
28, 2024, and supplemented on March 18, 2024. TVA is requesting an 
exemption, pursuant to section 72.7 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), in paragraphs 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 
72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require TVA to comply 
with the terms, conditions, and specifications of CoC No. 1032, 
Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1. If approved, the exemption would allow 
TVA to load five MPC-37-CBS beginning July 2024 in the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System at the WBN ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, 
conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, 
Revision No. 1, are not met.

II. Environmental Assessment

Background

    WBN is located in Rhea County, Tennessee, on the west bank of the 
Tennessee River at Tennessee River Mile 528. Unit 1 began operating in 
1996 and Unit 2 began operating in 2016. TVA has been storing spent 
fuel in an ISFSI at WBN under a general license as authorized by 10 CFR 
part 72, subpart K, ``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at 
Power Reactor Sites.'' TVA currently uses the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage 
System under CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1 for dry 
storage of spent nuclear fuel in a specific MPC (i.e., MPC-37) at the 
WBN ISFSI.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The CoC is the NRC approved design for each dry cask storage 
system. The proposed action would exempt the applicant from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 only as these requirements pertain to the use 
of the MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System for the near-
term planned loading of the systems. The exemption would allow WBN to 
load five MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the WBN 
ISFSI beginning July 2024, despite the MPC-37-CBS in the HI-STORM FW 
MPC Storage System not being in compliance with the terms, conditions, 
and specifications in the CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 
1.
    The HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System CoC provides the requirements, 
conditions, and operating limits necessary for use of the system to 
store spent fuel. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and 
manufacturer of the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, developed a variant 
of the design with CBS for the MPC-37, known as MPC-37-CBS. Holtec 
originally implemented the CBS variant design under the provisions of 
10 CFR 72.48, which allows licensees to make changes to cask designs 
without a CoC amendment under certain conditions (listed in 10 CFR 
72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to the cask designs, 
the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it implemented the CBS 
variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this was not the type of change 
allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued three 
Severity Level IV violations to Holtec. TVA plans to load five MPC-37-
CBS in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System beginning in July 2024. This 
exemption considers the near-term planned loading of the five canisters 
with the CBS variant basket design.

Need for the Proposed Action

    TVA requested this exemption in order to allow WBN to load five 
MPC-37-CBS in HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System at the WBN ISFSI for the 
future loading campaign scheduled to begin in July 2024. Approval of 
the exemption request would allow TVA to effectively manage the margin 
for full core reserve in the WBN spent fuel pool to enable refueling 
and offloading fuel from the reactor.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    This EA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting 
an exemption from the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1. The exemption would allow five 
MPC-37-

[[Page 27466]]

CBS to be loaded in the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System in the near-term 
loading campaign and maintained in storage at the WBN ISFSI.
    The potential environmental impacts of storing spent nuclear fuel 
in NRC-approved storage systems have been documented in previous 
assessments. On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC amended 10 CFR 
part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general 
license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final 
rule analyzed the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved 
storage casks. The EA for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, CoC No. 
1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1, (80 FR 58195), published in 
2015, tiers off of the EA issued for the July 18, 1990, final rule. 
``Tiering'' off earlier EAs is a standard process encouraged by the 
regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) that entails the use of impact analyses of previous EAs to bound 
the impacts of a proposed action where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM 
FW MPC Storage System is designed to mitigate the effects of design 
basis accidents that could occur during storage. Considering the 
specific design requirements for the accident conditions, the design of 
the cask would prevent loss of containment, shielding, and criticality 
control. If there is no loss of containment, shielding, or criticality 
control, the environmental impacts would not be significant.
    The exemptions requested by TVA at the WBN site as they relate to 
CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1, for the HI-STORM FW MPC 
Storage System are limited to the use of the CBS variant basket design 
only for the near-term planned loading of five canisters utilizing the 
CBS variant basket design. The staff has determined that this change in 
the basket would not result in either radiological or non-radiological 
environmental impacts that significantly differ from the environmental 
impacts evaluated in the environmental assessment supporting the 
issuance of CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 0, Revision No. 1. If the 
exemption is granted, there would be no significant change in the types 
or amounts of any effluents released, no significant increase in 
individual or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure, and 
no significant increase in the potential for or consequences from 
radiological accidents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that 
there would be no significant environmental impacts associated with the 
proposed action.

Alternative to the Proposed Action

    The staff considered the no-action alternative. The no-action 
alternative (denial of the exemption request) would require TVA to keep 
the spent fuel in the spent fuel pool until older design canisters can 
be fabricated and delivered to site. Not allowing the planned future 
loading campaign could affect TVA's ability to manage pool capacity, 
reactor fuel offloading, and refueling. Any further delay would lead to 
insufficient space in the spent fuel pool for core offload and the 
shutdown of WBN Unit 2, which in turn would potentially impact the 
energy supply in the area. The NRC has determined that these potential 
impacts of the no-action alternative could be avoided by proceeding 
with the proposed exemption, especially given that the staff has 
concluded in NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum, issued with respect 
to the enforcement action against Holtec regarding these violations, 
that fuel can be stored safely in the MPC-37-CBS casks.

Agencies Consulted

    The NRC provided the Tennessee Department of Environment and 
Conservation (TDEC) a copy of this draft EA for review by an email 
dated April 8, 2024. On April 9, 2024, the TDEC provided its 
concurrence by email.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action have been reviewed 
in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement 
NEPA. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the NRC finds 
that the proposed action of granting the exemption from the regulations 
in 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11) 
and 72.214, which require the licensee to comply with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of the CoC, would not significantly 
impact the quality of the human environment. The exemption in this case 
would be limited to the specific future loading of five canisters with 
the CBS variant basket design. Accordingly, the NRC has determined that 
a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) is appropriate, and an 
environmental impact statement is not warranted.

remove such information before making the comment submissions available 
to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses and Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination

    For the facility-specific amendment requests shown in this notice, 
the Commission finds that the licensees' analyses provided, consistent 
with section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) ``Notice for public comment; State consultation,'' are sufficient 
to support the proposed determinations that these amendment requests 
involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, 
operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments 
would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves NSHC. In addition, the Commission may issue any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period 
if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that 
failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or 
shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in

[[Page 26945]]

the Federal Register a notice of issuance. If the Commission makes a 
final NSHC determination for any of these amendments, any hearing will 
take place after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take 
action on any amendment before 60 days have elapsed will occur very 
infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's

[[Page 26946]]

electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.

Brief Description of Amendments...  On March 21, 2023, the NRC published
                                     a notice of consideration of
                                     approval of the application in the

                                     the scope of the amendment request
                                     was revised such that Neutron Flux
                                     remains as Function 1 in TS Table

III. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Combined Licenses

    During the period since publication of the last monthly notice, the 
Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has 
determined for each of these amendments that the application complies 
with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The 
Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    A notice of consideration of issuance of amendment to facility 
operating license or combined license, as applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing in connection with these 
actions, were published in the Federal Register as indicated in the 
safety evaluation for each amendment.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that 
these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.22(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to each action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession numbers for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

IV. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses and 
Combined Licenses and Final Determination of No Significant Hazards 
Consideration and Opportunity for a Hearing (Exigent Circumstances or 
Emergency Situation)

    Since publication of the last monthly notice, the Commission has 
issued the following amendment. The Commission has determined for this 
amendment that the application for the amendment complies with the 
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended 
(the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission 
has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    Because of exigent circumstances or emergency situation associated 
with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time for the 
Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 
notice of consideration of issuance of amendment, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing.
    In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have 
resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant 
or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in 
power output up to the plant's licensed power level (an emergency 
situation), the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide 
for public comment on its NSHC determination. In such case, the license 
amendment has been issued without opportunity for comment prior to 
issuance. Nonetheless, the State has been consulted by telephone 
whenever possible.
    Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an 
amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the pendency before it 
of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding 
and completion of any required hearing, where it has determined that 
NSHC is involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 
50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendments involve 
NSHC. The basis for this determination is contained in the NRC staff 
safety evaluation related to each action. Accordingly, the amendment 
has been issued and made effective as indicated. For those amendments 
that have not been previously noticed in the Federal Register, within 
60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any persons 
(petitioner) whose interest

[[Page 26950]]

may be affected by this action may file a request for a hearing and 
petition for leave to intervene (petition) with respect to the action. 
Petitions shall be filed in accordance with the guidance concerning the 
Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 
2 as discussed in section II.A of this document.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that the 
amendment satisfies the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for this amendment. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to these actions, see the 
amendment and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and 
safety evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession 
numbers indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will 
provide the ADAMS accession number(s) for the application for amendment 
and the Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All 
of these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining 
Information and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

                                     amendment allows the licensee to

                                     in the provisions of 10 CFR

II. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an amendment to Combined License 
No. NPF-91, issued to SNC, for operation of Vogtle, Unit 3, located in 
Burke County, Georgia. By letter dated April 4, 2024, SNC submitted a 
license amendment request to change Technical Specification (TS) 
5.5.13, ``Ventilation Filter Testing Program (VFTP),'' at Vogtle, Unit 
3. SNC proposes to provide an exception to the 24-month testing 
frequency to defer the next required performance until prior to startup 
from the first refueling outage. The licensee proposes that this 
exception would apply to in-place penetration and system bypass testing 
of the high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, in-place 
penetration and system bypass testing of the charcoal adsorber, and 
pressure drop testing across the HEPA filter, the charcoal adsorber, 
and the post filter, as specified in TS 5.5.13.a.1, 5.5.13.a.2, and 
5.5.13.a.4, respectively.
    Before any issuance of the proposed license amendment, the NRC will 
need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and NRC's regulations.
    The NRC has made a proposed determination that the license 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). 
Under the NRC's regulations in section 50.92 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), this means that operation of the facility 
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or 
(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required 
by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue 
of NSHC, which is presented as follows:
    1. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed change relaxes the time allowed to perform a 
Surveillance. The time between Surveillances is not an initiator to any 
accident previously evaluated. Consequently, the probability of an 
accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. The 
equipment being tested is still required to be operable and capable of 
performing the accident mitigation function assumed in the accident 
analysis. As a result, the consequences of any accident previously 
evaluated are not significantly affected.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated.
    2. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed change does not involve a physical alteration of the 
plant (no new or different type of equipment will be installed) or a 
change in the methods governing normal plant operation.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a 
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated.
    3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety?
    Response: No.
    The relaxed time allowed to perform a Surveillance does not result 
in a significant reduction in the margin of safety. As supported by the 
historical data, the likely outcome of any Surveillance is verification 
that the requirement is met. Failure to perform a Surveillance within 
the currently prescribed Frequency does not cause equipment to become 
inoperable. The only effect of the additional time allowed to perform 
the Surveillance on the margin of safety is the extension of the time 
until inoperable equipment is discovered to be inoperable by the missed 
Surveillance. Balancing the rare occurrence of an undiscovered 
inoperability against the actual risk of manipulating the plant 
equipment to perform the Surveillance, leads to a conclusion of 
enhanced plant safety margins. In addition, the diesel-backed normal 
ventilation system can perform the safety function of the filtration 
train should there be an undiscovered inoperability. Thus, there is 
confidence that plant safety margins are maintained.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant 
reduction in a margin of safety.
    The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on 
this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
license amendment request involves NSHC.
    The NRC is seeking public comments on this proposed determination 
that the license amendment request involves NSHC. Any comments received 
within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be 
considered in making any final determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice (the 
notice period). However, if circumstances change during the notice 
period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for 
example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may 
issue the license amendment before the expiration of the notice period, 
provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves 
NSHC. The final determination will consider all public and State 
comments received. If the Commission takes action prior to the 
expiration of either the comment period or the notice period, it will 
publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. The Commission 
expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of NSHC, the Commission will make a final 
determination on the issue of NSHC, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves NSHC, the Commission may issue the amendment and make 
it immediately effective, notwithstanding

[[Page 25285]]

the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place after issuance 
of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves a significant hazards consideration, then any hearing 
held would take place before the issuance of the amendment unless the 
Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety of the 
public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule under 
10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    For further details with respect to this action, see the 
application for license amendment dated April 4, 2024 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24095A354).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    By letter dated May 4, 2023, Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC 
or the licensee) submitted a request to the NRC for an exemption from 
paragraphs 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) for the Yankee Rowe Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation \1\ (ISFSI).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As discussed in this document, the Yankee Rowe ISFSI sits on 
the former site of Yankee Rowe, which YAEC finished decommissioning 
in 2007. Although only the Yankee Rowe ISFSI remains on the site, 
YAEC's 10 CFR part 50 license, Facility Operating License No. DPR-3 
remains in effect. Because YAEC requested an exemption from the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 50, this would be an exemption for 
YAEC's 10 CFR part 50 license rather than for YAEC's 10 CFR part 72 
general license. Therefore, although YAEC's submission requested an 
exemption for the Yankee Rowe ISFSI, the NRC staff will consider it 
a request for an exemption for YNPS.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    YAEC has established a separate (segregated) account within its 
over-arching nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT), entitled ``ISFSI 
Radiological Decom,'' that identifies the funds for radiological 
decommissioning of the ISFSI apart from the larger balance of funds in 
the NDT allocated for ongoing management of SNF and GTCC waste and for 
non-radiological site restoration activities. Although 10 CFR 50.82 
applies to the segregated account, it does not apply to the overall 
NDT.
    If granted, the exemptions from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 
50.75(h)(2) would permit YAEC to make withdrawals from the segregated 
account, on an annual basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-
radiological site restoration without prior notification to the NRC. 
More specifically, with this exemption, YAEC would be able to annually 
transfer funds exceeding 110 percent of the inflation-adjusted 
decommissioning cost estimate, described in 10 CFR 50.75, from the 
segregated account to its overarching NDT and use those funds for SNF 
and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration.
    YAEC received an operating license from the NRC in December 1963, 
and Yankee Rowe was permanently shut down in October 1991. In 1993, 
YAEC commenced decommissioning the power plant. The licensee 
constructed an onsite ISFSI under a general license and transferred the 
last canister containing GTCC material to the ISFSI in June 2003. The 
plant completed its final decommissioning of the reactor site, except 
for the ISFSI, which included dismantling and removing all reactor 
plant related facilities, in 2007. As a result, only the ISFSI remains 
at the old plant site of YNPS in Rowe, Massachusetts. By letter dated 
August 10, 2007, NRC approved the release of the majority of the YNPS 
site from the 10 CFR part 50 license (DPR-3) for unrestricted release, 
except for the ISFSI and immediately surrounding areas. Under its 10 
CFR part 72 general license, YAEC is authorized to possess, and store 
spent nuclear fuel at the permanently shut down and decommissioned 
facility under the provision of 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.''
    The NRC staff is performing both a safety evaluation and an 
environmental review to determine whether to grant this exemption 
request. The NRC staff will prepare a separate safety evaluation report 
(SER) to document its safety review and analysis. The NRC's SER will 
evaluate the proposed exemption for reasonable assurance of adequate 
protection of public health and safety, and the common defense and 
security. This EA documents the environmental review which the NRC 
staff prepared in accordance with 10 CFR 51.21 and 51.30(a). The NRC's 
decision whether to grant the exemption will be based on the results of 
the NRC staff's review as documented in this EA, and the staff's safety 
review to be documented in the SER.

II. Environmental Assessment

    By letter dated May 4, 2023, YAEC submitted a request to the NRC 
for an

[[Page 24878]]

exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2). If 
granted, the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 
50.75(h)(2) would permit YAEC to make withdrawals from the segregated 
account, on an annual basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-
radiological site restoration without prior notification to the NRC. 
More specifically, with this exemption, YAEC would be able to annually 
transfer funds exceeding 110 percent of the inflation-adjusted 
decommissioning cost estimate (DCE), described in 10 CFR 50.75, from 
the segregated account to its overarching NDT and use those funds for 
SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration 
activities.

Need for the Proposed Action

    As required by 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A), decommissioning trust 
funds may be used by the licensee if the withdrawals are for legitimate 
decommissioning activity expenses, consistent with the definition of 
decommissioning in 10 CFR 50.2. This definition addresses radiological 
decommissioning and does not include activities associated with 
management of SNF and GTCC waste or non-radiological site restoration. 
Similarly, the requirements of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) restrict the use of 
decommissioning trust fund disbursements (other than for ordinary and 
incidental expenses) to decommissioning expenses until final 
decommissioning has been completed.
    YAEC stated that it has established a segregated account, entitled 
``ISFSI Radiological Decom,'' within its over-arching NDT, that 
identifies the funds for radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI. 
This segregated account is separate from the larger balance of funds in 
the NDT allocated for ongoing management of SNF and GTCC waste and for 
other non-radiological site restoration activities. Therefore, 
exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) is needed to 
allow YAEC to use funds from the segregated account for SNF and GTCC 
waste management and other non-radiological site restoration 
activities.
    In its Decommissioning Funding Assurance Status Report dated March 
6, 2023, YAEC stated that its inflation-adjusted DCE for the 
radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI, is approximately $6.1 
million in 2022 dollars. It asserted this amount provides reasonable 
assurance of adequate funding to complete the NRC required 
decommissioning activities. In the same report, YAEC reported that, as 
of December 31, 2022, the segregated ``ISFSI Radiological Decom'' 
account had $22.5 million. More specifically, in its exemption request, 
YAEC provided a table showing $6,087,475, in 2022 dollars, as the 
inflation-adjusted DCE. YAEC's exemption request further stated that 
the segregated account has a balance of $22,496,631 as of December 31, 
2022, meaning that the segregated account had a balance of $16,409,156, 
or 270 percent beyond the inflation-adjusted DCE.
    YAEC stated that, if the exemption is granted, funds in its 
segregated account which exceed 110 percent of the inflation-adjusted 
DCE for the radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI would be 
transferred to the overarching NDT on an annual basis without prior NRC 
notification. YAEC would then use those funds for SNF and GTCC waste 
management and non-radiological site restoration, which in turn, would 
allow YAEC to return its additional excess funds in the overarching NDT 
to its customers as part of future rate cases with the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission.
    The requirements of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) further provide that, except 
for withdrawals being made under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) or for payments of 
ordinary administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the NDT 
in connection with the operation of the NDT, no disbursement may be 
made from the NDT without written notice to the NRC at least 30 working 
days in advance. Therefore, an exemption from 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) is 
also needed to allow YAEC to use funds from the segregated account for 
SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration 
activities without prior NRC notification.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action involves an exemption from requirements that 
are of financial and/or administrative nature and that do not have an 
impact on the environment. Before the NRC could approve the proposed 
action, it would have to conclude that there is reasonable assurance 
that adequate funds are available in the segregated account to complete 
all activities associated with radiological decommissioning as well as 
SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration. 
Therefore, there would be no decrease in safety associated with the use 
of funds from the segregated account to also fund activities associated 
with SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site-
restoration.
    The requested exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2), if approved, would allow 
transfers on an annual basis. YAEC stated that it will continue to 
provide its annual decommissioning funding assurance status report in 
accordance with 10 CFR 50.75(f)(1) and (2) and 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(v) 
and (vi) requirements. These reports provide the NRC staff with 
awareness of, and the ability to act on, any actual or potential 
funding deficiencies. As the proposed exemption would not affect these 
requirements, the NRC staff would have tools available for any 
potential funding deficiencies. Since the exemption would allow YAEC to 
use funds from the segregated account that are in excess of those 
required for radiological decommissioning, the adequacy of funds 
dedicated for radiological decommissioning would not be affected by the 
proposed exemption. Therefore, there is reasonable assurance that there 
would be no environmental impact due to lack of adequate funding for 
radiological decommissioning.
    Further, there are no new accident precursors created by using the 
excess funds from the segregated account for SNF and GTCC waste 
management and non-radiological site-restoration. The exemption, if 
granted, would be financial and/or administrative in nature. Thus, the 
probability of postulated accidents is not increased. Also, the 
consequences of postulated accidents are not increased. No changes are 
being made in the types or amounts of effluents that may be released 
offsite. There is no significant increase in occupational or public 
radiation exposure. Therefore, the requested exemption will not present 
an undue risk to the public health and safety.
    With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed 
action would have no direct impacts on land use or water resources, 
including terrestrial and aquatic biota, as it involves no new 
construction or modification of plant operational systems. There would 
be no changes to the quality or quantity of non-radiological effluents. 
In addition, there would be no noticeable effect on socioeconomic 
conditions in the region, no environmental justice impacts, no air 
quality impacts, and no impacts to historic and cultural resources from 
the proposed action. Therefore, there are no significant non-
radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
    For these reasons, the NRC concludes there are no significant 
environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption request.

[[Page 24879]]

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    In addition to the proposed action, the NRC staff also considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Denial of the exemption request would result in no change in current 
environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action 
and the alternative action would be similar.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies Consulted

    By email dated February 16, 2024, the NRC provided a copy of the 
draft EA to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Radiation 
Control Program, Bureau of Environmental Health, for review. By email 
dated March 14, 2024, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 
Radiation Control Program, Bureau of Environmental Health indicated 
that it had no comments.

Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation

    Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), 
requires Federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service or National Marine Fisheries Service regarding actions that may 
affect listed species or designated critical habitats. The ESA is 
intended to prevent further decline of endangered and threatened 
species and restore those species and their critical habitat.
    The NRC staff determined that a consultation under section 7 of the 
ESA is not required because the proposed action will not affect listed 
species or critical habitat.

National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Consultation

    Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) 
requires Federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings 
on historic properties. As stated in the NHPA, historic properties are 
any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or 
object included in, or eligible for inclusion in the National Register 
of Historic Places.
    The NRC determined that the scope of activities described in this 
exemption request do not have the potential to cause effects on 
historic properties because the NRC's approval of this exemption 
request will not authorize new construction or land disturbance 
activities. The NRC staff also determined that the proposed action is 
not a type of activity that has the potential to impact historic 
properties because the proposed action would occur within the 
established Yankee Rowe site boundary. Therefore, in accordance with 36 
CFR 800.3(a)(1), no consultation is required under section 106 of NHPA.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action--an exemption from 
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) 
allowing YAEC to make withdrawals from the segregated account, on an 
annual basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological 
site restoration without prior notification to the NRC--have been 
reviewed under the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
    The proposed exemption would not have a significant adverse effect 
on the probability of an accident occurring and would not have any 
significant radiological or non-radiological impacts. The proposed 
exemption involves an exemption from requirements that are of a 
financial and/or administrative nature and would not have an impact on 
the human environment. Consistent with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC conducted 
the EA for the proposed exemption, and this FONSI incorporates by 
reference the EA included in this document. Therefore, the NRC 
concludes that the proposed action will not have significant effects on 
the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has 
determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the 
proposed action.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Docket Nos. 72-37, 50-237, and 50-249

Constellation Energy Generation, LLC; Dresden Nuclear Power Station 
Unit 2 and Unit 3; Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation

I. Background

    Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation) is the holder 
of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-19 and DPR-25, which 
authorize operation of the Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2 and 
Unit 3 (Dresden) in Morris, Illinois, pursuant to Part 50 of Title 10 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities.'' The licenses provide, among 
other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations, 
and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) now or 
hereafter in effect.
    Consistent with 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General License for 
Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites,'' a general license is 
issued for the storage of spent fuel in an Independent Spent Fuel 
Storage Installation (ISFSI) at power reactor sites to persons 
authorized to possess or operate nuclear power reactors under 10 CFR 
part 50. Constellation is authorized to operate nuclear power reactors 
under 10 CFR part 50 and holds a 10 CFR part 72 general license for 
storage of spent fuel at the Dresden ISFSI. Under the terms of the 
general license, Constellation stores spent fuel at its Dresden ISFSI 
using the HI-STORM 100 Cask System in accordance with Certificate of 
Compliance (CoC) No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1.

II. Request/Action

    By a letter dated February 23, 2024 (Agencywide Documents Access 
and Management System [ADAMS] Accession No. ML24054A031), and 
supplemented on February 28, 2024 (ML24065A292) and March 8, 2024 
(ML24068A069), Constellation requested an exemption from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 that require Dresden to comply with the 
terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1014, Amendment 
No. 8, Revision No. 1 (ML16041A233). If approved, Constellation's 
exemption request would accordingly allow Dresden to maintain loaded 
and to load Multi-Purpose Canisters (MPC) with an unapproved, variant 
basket design (i.e., MPC-68M-CBS) in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System, and 
thus, to load the systems in a storage condition where the terms, 
conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, 
Revision No. 1 are not met.
    Constellation currently uses the HI-STORM 100 Cask System under CoC 
No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, for dry storage of spent 
nuclear fuel in MPC-68M at the Dresden ISFSI. Holtec International 
(Holtec), the designer and manufacturer of the HI-STORM 100 Cask 
System, developed a variant of the design with continuous basket shims 
(CBS) for the MPC-68M, known as MPC-68M-CBS. Holtec performed a non-
mechanistic tip-over analysis with favorable results and implemented 
the CBS variant design under the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48, ``Changes, 
tests, and experiments,'' which allows licensees to make changes to 
cask designs without a CoC amendment under certain conditions (listed 
in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to the cask 
designs, the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it implemented the 
CBS variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this is not the type of 
change allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, the NRC issued 
three Severity Level IV violations to Holtec (ML24016A190).
    Prior to the issuance of the violations, Constellation had loaded 
four MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System, which are safely in 
storage at the Dresden ISFSI. Constellation's near-term loading 
campaigns for the Dresden ISFSI include plans to load one MPC-68M-CBS 
in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System in May 2024 and four MPC-68M-CBS in 
March 2025. While Holtec was required to submit a CoC amendment to the 
NRC to seek approval of the CBS variant design, such a process will not 
be completed in time to inform decisions for these near-term loading 
campaigns. Therefore, Constellation submitted this exemption request in 
order to allow for the continued storage of the four already loaded 
MPC-68M-CBS, and future loadings of one MPC-68M-CBS in May 2024 and 
four in March 2025, at the Dresden ISFSI. This exemption is limited to 
the use of MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System only for the 
four already loaded systems and specific near-term planned loadings of 
five systems using the MPC-68M-CBS variant basket design.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations of 10 CFR part 72 as it determines are authorized by law 
and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and 
security and are otherwise in the public interest.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    This exemption would allow Constellation to maintain loaded and to 
load MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System at its Dresden ISFSI 
in a storage condition where the terms,

[[Page 24881]]

conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, 
Revision No. 1, are not met. Constellation is requesting an exemption 
from the provisions in 10 CFR part 72 that require the licensee to 
comply with the terms, conditions, and specifications of the CoC for 
the approved cask model it uses. Section 72.7 allows the NRC to grant 
exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 72. This authority to 
grant exemptions is consistent with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, and is not otherwise inconsistent with NRC's regulations or 
other applicable laws. Additionally, no other law prohibits the 
activities that would be authorized by the exemption. Therefore, the 
NRC concludes that there is no statutory prohibition on the issuance of 
the requested exemption, and the NRC is authorized to grant the 
exemption by law.

B. The Exemption Will Not Endanger Life or Property or the Common 
Defense and Security

    This exemption would allow Constellation to maintain loaded and to 
load MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System at the Dresden ISFSI 
in a storage condition where the terms, conditions, and specifications 
in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, are not met. In 
support of its exemption request, Constellation asserts that issuance 
of the exemption would not endanger life or property because the 
administrative controls the applicant has in place prevent a tip-over 
or handling event, and that the containment boundary would be 
maintained in such an event. Constellation relies, in part, on the 
approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum (ML24018A085). 
The NRC issued this Safety Determination Memorandum to address whether, 
with respect to the enforcement action against Holtec regarding this 
violation, there was any need to take an immediate action for the cask 
systems that were already loaded with non-compliant basket designs. The 
Safety Determination Memorandum documents a risk-informed approach 
concluding that, during the design basis event of a non-mechanistic 
tip-over, the fuel in the basket in the MPC-68M-CBS remains in a 
subcritical condition.
    Constellation also provided site-specific technical information, as 
supplemented, including information explaining why the use of the 
approach in the NRC's Safety Determination Memorandum is appropriate 
for determining the safe use of the CBS variant baskets at the Dresden 
ISFSI. Specifically, Constellation described that the analysis of the 
tip-over design basis event that is relied upon in the NRC's Safety 
Determination Memorandum, which demonstrates that the MPC confinement 
barrier is maintained, is documented in the updated final safety 
analysis report (UFSAR) for the HI-STORM 100 Cask System CoC No. 1014, 
Amendment 8, Revision No. 1 that is used at the Dresden site. 
Constellation also described its administrative controls for handling 
of the HI-STORM 100 Cask System at the Dresden ISFSI to prevent a tip-
over or handling event. Those controls include operational procedures 
that demonstrate that the system is handled with a single failure proof 
device, complying with ANSI N14.6, ``for Radioactive Materials--Special 
Lifting Devices for Shipping Containers Weighing 10 000 Pounds (4500 
kg) or More,'' and consistent with NUREG-612, ``Control of Heavy Loads 
at Nuclear Power Plants,'' (ML070250180) for heavy load lifting 
component, inside of the Reactor Buildings and during transport to the 
ISFSI. In addition, the transporter includes redundant drop protection.
    Additionally, Constellation provided specific information from 
Dresden's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 15, indicating that during 
the design basis event of a non-mechanistic tip-over, Dresden's ISFSI 
would meet the requirements in 10 CFR 72.104, ``Criteria for 
radioactive materials in effluents and direct radiation from an ISFSI 
or MRS,'' and 72.106, ``Controlled area of an ISFSI or MRS.'' 
Specifically, Constellation described that, in the highly unlikely 
event of a tip-over, any potential fuel damage from a non-mechanistic 
tip-over event would be localized, the confinement barrier would be 
maintained, and the shielding material would remain intact. Coupled 
with the distance of the Dresden ISFSI to the site area boundary, 
Constellation concluded that compliance with 72.104 and 72.106 is not 
impacted by approving this exemption request.
    The NRC staff reviewed the information provided by Constellation 
and concludes that issuance of the exemption would not endanger life or 
property because the administrative controls Constellation has in place 
at the Dresden ISFSI sufficiently minimize the possibility of a tip-
over or handling event, and that the containment boundary would be 
maintained in such an event. The staff confirmed that these 
administrative controls comply with the technical specifications and 
UFSAR for the HI-STORM 100 Cask System CoC No. 1014, Amendment 8, 
Revision No. 1 that is used at the Dresden site. In addition, the staff 
confirmed that the information provided by Constellation regarding 
Dresden's 72.212 Evaluation Report, Revision 15, demonstrates that the 
consequences of normal and accident conditions would be within the 
regulatory limits of the 10 CFR 72.104 and 10 CFR 72.106. The staff 
also determined that the requested exemption is not related to any 
aspect of the physical security or defense of the Dresden ISFSI; 
therefore, granting the exemption would not result in any potential 
impacts to common defense and security.
    For these reasons, the NRC staff has determined that under the 
requested exemption, the storage system will continue to meet the 
safety requirements of 10 CFR part 72 and the offsite dose limits of 10 
CFR part 20 and, therefore, will not endanger life or property or the 
common defense and security.

C. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The proposed exemption would allow the four already loaded MPC-68M-
CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System to remain in storage at the Dresden 
ISFSI, and allow Constellation to load one MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 
100 Cask System in May 2024 and four MPC-68M-CBS in March 2025,at the 
Dresden ISFSI, even though the CBS variant basket design is not part of 
the approved CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1. According 
to Constellation, the exemption is in the public interest because 
unloading fuel from already loaded canisters and not being able to load 
fuel into dry storage in future loading campaigns would impact 
Constellation's ability to offload fuel from the Dresden reactor units, 
consequently impacting continued safe reactor operation. The reflooding 
of the MPCs, removal of fuel assemblies, and replacement into a 
different MPC would result in additional doses and handling operations 
with no added safety benefit. In addition, future loading campaigns 
would need to be delayed until older design canisters can be fabricated 
and delivered to the site.
    Constellation stated that to unload already loaded MPC-68M-CBS or 
delay the future loading campaigns would impact the ability to 
effectively manage the margin to full core discharge capacity in the 
Dresden Unit 2 and Unit 3 spent fuel pools. The low spent fuel pool 
capacity would make it difficult to refuel and present potential risks 
to fuel handling operations during pre- and post-outage. In addition, a 
crowded spent fuel pool would challenge the

[[Page 24882]]

decay heat removal demand of the pool and increase the likelihood of a 
loss of fuel pool cooling event and a fuel handling accident. 
Furthermore, Dresden planned the cask loading campaigns years in 
advance based on availability of the specialized workforce and 
equipment that is shared throughout the Constellation fleet. These 
specialty resources support competing priorities including refueling 
outages, loading campaigns, fuel pool cleanouts, fuel inspections, fuel 
handing equipment upgrade and maintenance, fuel sipping, new fuel 
receipt, and crane maintenance and upgrades. Any delays would have a 
cascading impact on other scheduled specialized activities.
    For the reasons described by Constellation in the exemption 
request, the NRC agrees that it is in the public interest to grant the 
exemption. If the exemption is not granted, in order to comply with the 
CoC, Constellation would have to unload MPC-68M-CBS from the HI-STORM 
100 Cask System at the Dresden ISFSI and reload into the older design 
MPC-68M to restore compliance with terms, conditions, and 
specifications of the CoC. This would subject onsite personnel to 
additional radiation exposure, increase the risk of a possible fuel 
handling accident, and increase the risk of a possible heavy load 
handling accident. Furthermore, the removed spent fuel would need to be 
placed in the spent fuel pool until it can be loaded into another 
storage cask or remain in the spent fuel pool if it is not permitted to 
be loaded into casks for future loading campaigns. As described by 
Constellation, this scenario would affect Constellation's ability to 
effectively manage the spent pool capacity and reactor fuel offloading 
at Dresden. In addition, the rescheduling of the specialized resources 
for the future loading campaigns would impact the operations of Dresden 
and other Constellation sites.
    Therefore, the staff concludes that approving the exemption is in 
the public interest.
Environmental Consideration
    The NRC staff also considered whether there would be any 
significant environmental impacts associated with the exemption. For 
this proposed action, the NRC staff performed an environmental 
assessment pursuant to 10 CFR 51.30. The environmental assessment 
concluded that the proposed action would not significantly impact the 
quality of the human environment. The NRC staff concluded that the 
proposed action would not result in any changes in the types or amounts 
of any radiological or non-radiological effluents that may be released 
offsite, and there would be no significant increase in occupational or 
public radiation exposure because of the proposed action. The 
environmental assessment and the finding of no significant impact was 
published on April 1, 2024 (89 FR 22463).

IV. Conclusion

    Based on these considerations, the NRC has determined that, 
pursuant to 10 CFR 72.7, the exemption is authorized by law, will not 
endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is 
otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the NRC grants 
Constellation an exemption from the requirements of Sec. Sec.  
72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 
with respect to the ongoing storage of four MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 
100 Cask System and future loading in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System of 
one MPC-68M-CBS in May 2024 and four MPC-68M-CBS in March 2025.
    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

II. Background

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
chapter 35), the NRC is requesting public comment on its intention to 
request the OMB's approval for the information collection summarized 
below.
    1. The title of the information collection: Reactor Site Criteria.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0093.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: As necessary 
in order for the NRC to assess the adequacy of proposed seismic design 
bases and the design bases for other site hazards for small modular 
reactors (SMRs) and/or non-light water reactors (LWRs) constructed and 
licensed in accordance with parts 50 and 52 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Applicants who apply 
for an early site permit (ESP), combined license (COL) or a 
construction permit (CP) or operating license (OL) on or after January 
10, 1997.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 13.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 13.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 482,412 hours.
    10. Abstract: 10 CFR part 100, ``Reactor Site Criteria,'' 
establishes approval requirements for proposed sites for the purpose of 
constructing and operating stationary SMRs and/or non-LWRs. Subpart B, 
``Evaluation Factors for Stationary Power Reactor Site Applications on 
or After January 10, 1997,'' requirements apply to applicants who apply 
for an ESP, COL or a CP or OL on or after January 10, 1997. This 
clearance is necessary since the NRC is expecting approximately 8 SMR 
and/or non-LWR siting applications over the next 3 years. The 
applicants must provide information regarding the physical 
characteristics of the site in addition to the potential for natural 
phenomena and man-made hazards. This includes information on 
meteorological hazards (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, snowfall, and 
extreme temperatures), hydrologic hazards (such as floods, tsunami, and 
seiches) geologic hazards (such as faulting, seismic hazards, and the 
maximum credible earthquake) and factors such as population density, 
the proximity of man-related hazards (e.g., airports, dams, 
transportation routes, military and chemical facilities), and site 
hydrological and atmospheric dispersion characteristics. The NRC staff 
reviews the submitted information and, if necessary, may generate a 
request for additional information. The staff meets with the applicant 
and conducts a site visit to resolve any open issues. When the open 
issues have been resolved, the staff writes the final safety evaluation 
report, which is published and used as a basis for the remainder of the 
NRC licensing process.

III. Specific Requests for Comments

    The NRC is seeking comments that address the following questions:
    1. Is the proposed collection of information necessary for the NRC 
to properly perform its functions? Does the information have practical 
utility? Please explain your answer.
    2. Is the estimate of the burden of the information collection 
accurate? Please explain your answer.
    3. Is there a way to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected?
    4. How can the burden of the information collection on respondents 
be minimized, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    In accordance with section 51.118 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), the NRC is making available for public 
inspection NUREG-1437, Supplement 5a, Second Renewal, regarding the 
subsequent renewal of Florida Power & Light Company's (FPL) Renewed 
Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-31 and DPR-41 for an additional 20 
years of operation for Turkey Point. A notice of availability of the 
draft of NUREG-1437, Supplement 5a, Second Renewal, was published in 
the Federal Register on September 8, 2023, by the NRC (88 FR 62110) and 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (88 FR 62078). The public 
comment period on the draft EIS ended on November 7, 2023, and the 
comments received are addressed in the final EIS.

II. Discussion

    As discussed in Chapter 3 of NUREG-1437, Supplement 5a, Second 
Renewal, the NRC staff's recommendation is that the adverse 
environmental impacts of subsequent license renewal for Turkey Point 
for an additional 20 years beyond the expiration dates of the initial 
renewed licenses are not so great that preserving the option of 
subsequent license renewal for energy-planning decisionmakers would be 
unreasonable. This recommendation is based on: (1) FPL's environmental 
report, as supplemented; (2) the NRC staff's consultations with 
Federal, State, Tribal, and local government agencies; (3) the NRC 
staff's independent environmental review, which is documented in NUREG-
1437, Supplement 5a, Second Renewal; and (4) the NRC staff's 
consideration of public comments.

    Dated: April 1, 2024.

Attachment--Exemption

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Docket No. 52-048

NuScale Power, LLC

US600 Standard Design Certification and Standard Design Approval

I. Background

    The NuScale Standard Plant Design Certification Application (DCA) 
was submitted to the NRC on January 6, 2017, pursuant to the 
requirements of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power 
Plants'' (ML17013A229). NuScale submitted the final version of its 
Standard Plant DCA, Revision 5, by letter dated July 29, 2020 
(ML20225A044), and requested approval of the NuScale design as 
described in the NuScale DCA, under subpart E, ``Standard Design 
Approvals,'' of 10 CFR part 52. By letter dated August 28, 2020 
(ML20231A804), the NRC informed NuScale that the plant design meets the 
applicable requirements for the DC stage of licensing, and, on 
September 11, 2020, the SDA request was granted (ML20247J564). On 
January 19, 2023, the NRC amended its regulations to certify the 
NuScale standard design (88 FR 3287).
    By letter dated June 29, 2023 (ML23180A151), NuScale requested an 
exemption from the reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii) as 
applicable to Topical Report ``Loss-of-Coolant Accident Analysis 
Methodology,'' TR-0516-49422-P-A,

[[Page 24041]]

Revision 2 (Non-proprietary version: ML20189A644).
    Section 50.46(a)(1)(i) in part provides requirements for models 
used in calculations regarding Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) 
performance following postulated loss of coolant accidents. Section 
50.46(a)(3)(iii) requires that a holder of a standard DC or a holder of 
a SDA report any change or error found in such ECCS performance models, 
including the nature of the change or error and its estimated effect on 
the limiting ECCS analysis, at least annually. The regulation further 
requires that if the change or error is significant, a report is to be 
provided within 30 days and include a proposed schedule for reanalysis 
or other action needed to show compliance with Sec.  50.46 
requirements, and requires that the DC or SDA holder propose immediate 
steps to demonstrate compliance or bring plant design into compliance. 
A significant change or error is described in section 50.46(a)(3)(i) as 
one which results in a calculated peak fuel cladding temperature 
difference by more than 50 [deg]F from the temperature calculated for 
the limiting transient using the last acceptable model, either alone or 
in combination with other changes and errors, such that the sum of the 
absolute magnitudes of the respective temperature changes is greater 
than 50 [deg]F.

II. Request/Action

    In a letter dated June 29, 2023 (ML23180A151), NuScale requested an 
exemption from both the annual and 30-day reporting requirements of 10 
CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii) as applicable to Topical Report ``Loss-of-Coolant 
Accident Analysis Methodology,'' TR-0516-49422-P-A, Revision 2 
(ML20189A644). Revision 2 of that topical report documents an 
acceptable ECCS Evaluation Model (EM) and is incorporated by reference 
in the final safety analysis report supporting NuScale's US600 SDA and 
DC. NuScale stated that neither the US600 SDA, DC, nor the associated 
ECCS EM is currently referenced or anticipated to be referenced by an 
application for constructing or operating a nuclear facility. NuScale 
stated its intent to resume reporting changes and errors in the event 
that a future license application references the US600 SDA, DC, or TR-
0516-49422-P-A, Revision 2.

III. Discussion

    The regulation for which the exemption is sought has two reporting 
requirements. The first requirement is that changes or errors 
discovered in an acceptable EM and their effect on the limiting ECCS 
analysis shall be reported at least annually. The second requirement is 
that, if those changes or errors are significant, a report shall be 
provided within 30 days and include a schedule for providing reanalysis 
or other action needed to show compliance, and a proposal of immediate 
steps to bring the plant design into compliance. A significant change 
or error, as it relates to this regulation, is defined as one which 
results in a calculated peak fuel cladding temperature difference by 
more than 50 [deg]F from the last acceptable model.
    As discussed below, the NRC staff reviewed this request and 
determined that it is appropriate to grant the exemption, in accordance 
with the regulations as the exemption does not present an undue risk to 
public health or safety, is consistent with the common defense and 
security, and special circumstances exist.
    Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by 
any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from 
the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, including 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii), 
when: (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present an 
undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the 
common defense and security; and (2) special circumstances are present. 
As stated in the regulation, and as relevant to the requested 
exemption, special circumstances may exist if application of the 
regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the 
underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the 
underlying purpose of the rule (10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii)).
    The purpose of 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii) is to provide timely 
reporting to the NRC regarding the nature and estimated effect of any 
change or error in the limiting ECCS analysis. In its request, NuScale 
committed to perform necessary reporting to a reactor license applicant 
and the NRC if the US600 SDA, DC, or TR-0516-49422-P-A, Revision 2, is 
referenced by a future applicant. The staff notes that 10 CFR 
50.46(a)(3)(ii) requires an applicant that seeks to construct or 
operate a facility using the design to make similar reports. Further, 
10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(i) requires a DC or SDA holder to estimate the 
effect of any change to or error in an acceptable EM or in the 
application of such a model to determine if the change or error is 
significant, ensuring that changes and errors would continue to be 
documented internally by the DC or SDA holders, and be available for 
NRC inspection. The staff also notes that 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii) 
requires not only that changes or errors in the ECCS EM be reported, 
but also that changes or errors in the application of the EM be 
reported. Since TR-0516-49422-P-A, Revision 2, was incorporated by 
reference into the approved SDA and DC for the design, in the event 
that the SDA or DC is referenced by a future applicant, compliance with 
10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii) would need to include both changes or errors in 
the ECCS EM, as well as changes or errors in the application of the EM.

No Undue Risk to Public Health and Safety

    The purpose of 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii) is to provide for timely 
notification of the nature and estimated effect of any errors or 
changes in the limiting ECCS analysis. In the absence of any 
application to utilize the referenced design for constructing or 
operating a nuclear facility, there is no undue risk to public health 
and safety. The requested exemption is administrative in nature and 
pertains only to the requirements for reporting in 10 CFR 
50.46(a)(3)(iii). No new accident precursors would be created as a 
result of the requested exemption; therefore, neither the probability 
nor the consequences of postulated accidents would be increased. The 
reporting of any changes or errors in the limiting ECCS analysis would 
resume when an application for a license that references the US600 SDA, 
DCA or the associated ECCS EM is submitted to the NRC. The request for 
an exemption from the annual and 30-day reporting requirements 
therefore have no bearing on public health and safety and poses no 
undue risk to public health and safety.

Consistent With Common Defense and Security

    The requested exemption is administrative in nature and pertains 
only to the requirements for reporting in 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii). In 
the absence of any application to utilize the referenced design, this 
exemption has no relation to security issues; therefore, the common 
defense and security is not impacted.

Special Circumstances

    Special circumstances, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2), may 
be present relevant to the requested exemption. Specifically, 10 CFR 
50.12(a)(2)(ii) states, in part, that special circumstances may exist 
if application

[[Page 24042]]

of the regulation in the particular circumstances would not serve the 
underlying purpose of the rule or is not necessary to achieve the 
underlying purpose of the rule.
    The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii) is to ensure that 
the NRC receives timely notification of the nature and estimated effect 
of errors or changes in the limiting ECCS analysis for a design or 
facility. These requirements for holders of SDAs and DCs were added to 
10 CFR 50.46 in 2007 (72 FR 49352), with the Statements of 
Consideration noting that, ``[c]onforming references to design 
approvals, design certifications, and licenses issued under part 52 
were made to Sec.  50.46, so that the NRC will be notified of changes 
to or errors in acceptable EMs, or the application of such models, that 
were used in licenses, certifications, and approvals issued under part 
52.'' For designs that are not yet referenced in an application for 
constructing or operating a nuclear facility, the NRC staff's review of 
any changes or errors noted in the annual report is generally performed 
to confirm that the design continues to comply with the acceptance 
criteria in 10 CFR 50.46(b). Considering the ample margin in the US600 
design relative to the ECCS acceptance criteria in 10 CFR 50.46(b), the 
NRC staff has reasonable assurance that reporting of changes or errors 
as part of the annual reporting requirement is not necessary to assure 
continued compliance with the applicable acceptance criteria.
    NuScale's exemption request also includes a request for exemption 
from the 30-day reporting requirement pertaining to significant changes 
or errors and associated corrective actions. Timely notice to the NRC 
of significant underlying changes or errors and associated corrective 
actions is valuable because it enables the NRC staff to evaluate the 
continued ability of the SDA or DC to comply with the acceptance 
criteria in 10 CFR 50.46(b) in a timely manner. As discussed in the 
Statements of Consideration accompanying the 10 CFR part 52 final rule 
(54 FR 15372), that rule was intended to achieve the early resolution 
of licensing issues, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of 
nuclear power plants and reducing the complexity and uncertainty of the 
licensing process. As described previously, 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(i) 
requires a DC or SDA holder to estimate the effect of any change to or 
error in an acceptable EM or in the application of such a model to 
determine if the change or error is significant, ensuring that changes 
and errors would continue to be documented internally by the DC or SDA 
holders, and be available for NRC inspection. If the NRC receives an 
application that references the NuScale DC, SDA, or TR-0516-49422-P-A, 
Rev. 2, NuScale, as the DC and SDA holder, will be required to resume 
the reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.46(a)(iii). By complying with 
the 10 CFR 50.46(a)(i) requirement to internally document any changes 
or errors in the accepted EM or application of the model, the applicant 
and the NRC would still be able to achieve resolution of such issues 
early in the licensing process and continue to reduce uncertainty in 
the licensing process, thereby achieving the underlying purpose of the 
rule. The staff also notes that an applicant to construct or operate a 
plant utilizing the DC or SDA design would be responsible for providing 
an acceptable analysis of the ECCS in its application to the NRC.
    Therefore, for the above stated reasons, the NRC staff finds that 
NuScale's compliance with the reporting requirements, prior to the 
submittal of any application to utilize the referenced design, is not 
necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule, and that 
special circumstances for the requested exemption from the annual and 
30-day reporting requirements in 50.46(a)(3)(iii) are present under 10 
CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii).

Eligibility for Categorical Exclusion From Environmental Review

    With respect to the exemption's impact on the quality of the human 
environment, the NRC staff has determined that the exemption from 
reporting that was requested by NuScale is eligible for categorical 
exclusion as identified in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(25), in that:
    (i) There is no significant hazards consideration;
    The criteria for determining whether there is no significant 
hazards consideration are found in 10 CFR 50.92. The proposed action 
involves only a change regarding the requirements for the submission of 
reports on errors or changes in the ECCS analysis and EM for the US600 
DC and SDA, neither of which has yet been referenced by an applicant or 
licensee seeking to utilize either design or to utilize the referenced 
EM. The reporting of changes or errors would have no bearing on the 
operation of any operating reactor, or any existing application to 
construct or operate a reactor, prior to the submittal of an 
application to utilize either design. Therefore, there is no 
significant hazards consideration because granting the proposed 
exemption would not:
    (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or
    (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any accident previously evaluated; or
    (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
    (ii) There is no significant change in the types or significant 
increase in the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite;
    The proposed action involves only a change to reporting 
requirements and does not have any bearing on the operation of any 
operating reactor, or any application to construct or operate a 
reactor, and does not involve any changes in the types or any 
significant increase in the amounts of effluents that may be released 
offsite.
    (iii) There is no significant increase in individual or cumulative 
public or occupational radiation exposure;
    Since the proposed action involves only a change to reporting 
requirements and does not have any bearing on the operation of any 
operating reactor, or any application to construct or operate a 
reactor, the exemption does not contribute to any significant increase 
in occupational or public radiation exposure.
    (iv) There is no significant construction impact;
    The proposed action involves only a change to reporting 
requirements, which is administrative in nature. This DC and SDA have 
not yet been referenced by any applicant to construct or operate a 
reactor. Accordingly, the proposed action does not involve any 
construction impact.
    (v) There is no significant increase in the potential for or 
consequences from radiological accidents;
    The proposed action involves only a change to reporting 
requirements and does not have any bearing on the operation of an 
operating reactor, or any application to construct or operate a 
reactor, and it therefore does not impact the probability or 
consequences of radiological accidents. In the future, if an 
application to construct or operate a reactor utilizing the SDA or DC 
design, or referencing the applicable EM, is submitted, the reporting 
requirements would be triggered, and the NRC's consideration of the 
requested licensing action would necessarily include consideration of 
those reports in evaluating the potential for or consequences of 
radiological accidents.
    (vi) The requirements from which an exemption is sought involve:
    (1) Reporting requirements;
    The exemption request involves submitting the annual and 30-day

[[Page 24043]]

reports required by 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii); and
    (2) Scheduling requirements;
    The proposed exemption relieves that applicant from submitting the 
required reports until NRC receives a request to reference the NuScale 
US600 DC, SDA or Topical Report TR-0516-49422-P-A, Revision 2 
(ML20189A644). If an application to use the US600 SDA, DC, or TR-0516-
49422-P-A, Revision 2, is referenced in a license application, NuScale 
will then be required to submit the reports required by regulation to 
the NRC.
    Based on the discussion above, the NRC staff concludes that the 
exemption request meets the requirements in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(25) and is 
eligible for categorical exclusion from environmental review.

IV. Conclusion

    For the reasons discussed in Section III.B above, the NRC concludes 
that NuScale's requested exemption from the annual and 30-day reporting 
requirements in 10 CFR 50.46(a)(3)(iii) satisfies the applicable 
requirements in 10 CFR 50.12 and should be granted. The exemption from 
the annual and 30-day reporting requirements is effective upon 
issuance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC staff is issuing a new guide in the NRC's ``Regulatory 
Guide'' series. This series was developed to describe

[[Page 22913]]

methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific 
parts of the agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff 
uses in evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to 
describe information that the staff needs in its review of applications 
for permits, certifications, approvals, and licenses.
    RG 1.253, Revision 0, ``Guidance for a Technology-Inclusive Content 
of Application Methodology to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of 
Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-
Water Reactors,'' provides guidance to assist interested parties and 
prospective applicants in the development of content for major portions 
of their safety analysis reports required in applications for permits, 
licenses, certifications, and approvals by the NRC to ensure that 
applications for non-LWR facility designs using the LMP process meet 
the minimum requirements for construction permit, operating license, 
combined license, or design certification applications.

II. Additional Information

    RG 1.253 was issued as a draft regulatory guide (DG) with a 
temporary identification of DG-1404 (ADAMS Accession No. ML22076A003).
    The NRC published DG-1404, Revision 0 in the Federal Register on 
May 25, 2023 (88 FR 33846), for a 45-day public comment period. 
Subsequently, the comment period was extended by 30-days as noted in 
the Federal Register June 28, 2023 (88 FR 41862). The public comment 
period closed on August 10, 2023. On September 8, 2023, the NRC 
published a request for public comment on Revision 1 to DG-1404 in the 
Federal Register (88 FR 61989). Revision 1 to DG-1404 provided 
additional guidance for the scope, level of detail, elements and plant 
representation for a probabilistic risk assessment supporting an LMP-
based construction permit application. The public comment period for 
Revision 1 to DG-1404 closed on October 10, 2023. Public comments on 
DG-1404 Revision 0 and Revision 1, and the staff responses to the 
public comments are available in ADAMS under Accession No. ML23269A223.
    The NRC staff anticipates the submission of advanced power-reactor 
applications within the next few years based on preapplication 
engagement initiated by several prospective applicants. Because many of 
these designs are non-LWRs, the NRC staff developed technology-
inclusive, risk-informed, performance-based guidance to support the 
development of major portions of safety analysis report content for 
these non-LWR applications. The guidance describes the development of 
major portions of the safety analysis report using the industry-
developed guidance contained in Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) 21-07, 
Revision 1, ``Technology Inclusive Guidance for Non-Light-Water 
Reactors, Safety Analysis Report Content for Applicants Using the NEI 
18-04 Methodology,'' (ADAMS Accession No. ML22060A190). The guidance 
will facilitate the development of non-LWR applications for 
construction permits or operating licenses under part 50 of title 10 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities,'' or combined licenses or design 
certifications under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and 
Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants.''
    The NRC staff notes it is developing a rule to amend parts 50 and 
52 to align reactor licensing processes and incorporate lessons learned 
from new reactor licensing into the regulations (RIN 3150-Al66). This 
RG may need to be updated to conform to changes to 10 CFR parts 50 and 
52, if any, adopted through that rulemaking. Further, as of the date of 
this RG, the NRC staff is developing an optional performance-based, 
technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing nuclear power 
plants designated as 10 CFR part 53 (RIN 3150-AK31). The NRC intends to 
revise this guidance as a part of the ongoing rulemaking for 10 CFR 
part 53.
    To standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, 
the staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content of 
Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of 
Application Project (TICAP). The ARCAP is an NRC-led activity that is 
intended to result in guidance for a complete non-LWR application for 
review under 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52, and which the staff 
would update, as appropriate, pending the issuance of the 10 CFR part 
50 and 10 CFR part 52 rulemaking previously mentioned in this document, 
or if the Commission issues a final 10 CFR part 53 rule.
    The TICAP is an industry led guidance activity focused on the scope 
and depth of information to include in the portions of a safety 
analysis report that address the implementation of the LMP methodology 
described in NEI 18-04, Revision 1, and endorsed by the NRC in 
Regulatory Guide 1.233, ``Guidance for a Technology-Inclusive, Risk-
Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology to Inform the Licensing 
Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and 
Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,'' (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20091L698).
    During the 711th meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor 
Safeguards (ACRS), December 6-7, 2023, the ACRS, the NRC staff, and 
representatives of other stakeholders discussed guidance documents 
related to the ARCAP and the TICAP. On December 20, 2023, the ACRS 
issued a report documenting its review of these guidance documents 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23348A182). The conclusions and recommendations 
in the ACRS report apply to all the ARCAP and TICAP guidance documents. 
In its December 2023 report, the ACRS also recommended specific changes 
to DG-1404. As set forth in its letter dated March 18, 2024, (ADAMS No. 
ML24024A025) in which the NRC staff responded to the ACRS report, the 
NRC staff revised RG 1.253 to address specific ACRS recommendations.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under 1 CFR 
chapter I.
    The table in this rulemaking provides the document description, 
ADAMS accession number, and, if appropriate, the docket identification 
number on supporting documents associated with the document that is the 
subject of this Federal Register document.

III. Congressional Review Act

    This RG is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    RG 1.253, Revision 0, does not constitute backfitting as defined in 
10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in Management 
Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue 
Finality, and Information Requests''; does not constitute forward 
fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 8.4; and does not 
affect the issue finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52. 
The guidance would not apply to any current licensees or applicants or 
existing or requested approvals under 10 CFR part 52, and therefore its 
issuance cannot be a backfit or forward fit or affect issue finality. 
Further, as explained in RG 1.253, applicants and licensees would not 
be required to comply with the positions set forth in RG 1.253.

V. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

    Dated: March 28, 2024.

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, NRC 
Form 149, ``OCFO Invitational Traveler Request Form.'' The NRC hereby 
informs potential respondents that an agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and that a person is not required to respond to, a collection 
of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on December 15, 2023, 88 FR 
86948.
    1. The title of the information collection: NRC Form 149, OCFO 
Invitational Traveler Request Form.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0247.
    3. Type of submission: Revision.
    4. The form number, if applicable: NRC Form 149.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: The 
collection is required when there is an invitational traveler that will 
be reimbursed by the NRC. This occurs on an as needed basis and does 
not have a regular schedule for submission.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: The invitational 
traveler will be asked to respond and NRC staff that are associated 
with the purpose of the invitational traveler may also be asked to 
respond on an as needed basis.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 435.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 435.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 109.
    10. Abstract: The NRC provides reimbursement for people on 
invitational travel for the NRC. As such, the NRC would reimburse them 
through our Financial Accounting and Integrated Management Information 
System (FAIMIS). Additionally, the travel itself would be processed in 
our electronic travel systems (ETS2). Both the financial and travel 
systems must be set up appropriately for the invitational traveler to 
travel and receive reimbursement from the NRC. The information 
collected on Form 149 meets the requirements for the invitational 
traveler to have a profile created in FAIMIS and in ETS2. The 
information collected is necessary to meet the criteria for both 
systems.

    Dated: March 29, 2024.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated January 19, 2024 (ADAMS Package Accession No. 
ML24019A009), Tennessee Valley Authority, submitted to the NRC an 
application for subsequent license renewal of Renewed Facility 
Operating License No. DPR-33, DPR-52, and DPR-68, for Units 1, 2, and 
3, for an additional 20 years of operation. This submission initiated 
the NRC's proposed action of determining whether to grant the SLR 
application. Browns Ferry Units 1, 2, and 3 are boiling water reactors 
designed by General Electric and are located on the north shore of 
Wheeler Reservoir in Limestone County Alabama at the Tennessee River 
Mile 294. The current renewed facility operating license for Units 1, 
2, and 3, expire at midnight on December 20, 2033, June 28, 2034, and 
July 2, 2036, respectively. The SLR application was submitted pursuant 
to part 54 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
``Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Power 
Plants,'' and seeks to extend the renewed facility operating licenses 
for Units 1, 2, and 3, to midnight on December 20, 2053, June 28, 2054, 
and July 2, 2056, respectively. A notice of receipt and availability of 
the application was published in the Federal Register on February 8, 
2024 (89 FR 8725). A notice of acceptance for docketing of the 
application and of opportunity to request a hearing was published in 
the Federal Register on March 21, 2024 (89 FR 20254) and is available 
on the Federal rulemaking website (https://www.regulations.gov) by 
searching for Docket ID NRC-2024-0030.

III. Request for Comment

    This notice informs the public of the NRC's intention to conduct 
environmental scoping and prepare an EIS related to the SLR application 
for Browns Ferry, and to provide the public an opportunity to 
participate in the environmental scoping process, as defined in 10 CFR 
51.29, ``Scoping-environmental impact statement and supplement to 
environmental impact statement,'' and 10 CFR 51.116, ``Notice of 
intent.''
    The regulations in 36 CFR 800.8, ``Coordination with the National 
Environmental Policy Act,'' allow agencies to use their National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) (NEPA) 
process to fulfill the requirements of Section 106 of the National 
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 U.S.C. 300101, et seq.) (NHPA).
    Therefore, pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8(c), the NRC intends to use its 
process and documentation required for the preparation of the EIS on 
the proposed action to comply with Section 106 of the NHPA in lieu of 
the procedures set forth at 36 CFR 800.3 through 800.6.
    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.53(c) and 10 CFR 54.23, Tennessee 
Valley Authority submitted an ER as part of the SLR application. The ER 
was prepared pursuant to 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection 
Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions,'' 
and is available in ADAMS under Accession No. ML24023A476. The ER will 
also be available for viewing at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications/browns-ferry-subsequent.html.
    In addition, the SLR application, including the ER, is available 
for public review at the Athens-Limestone County Public Library, 603 S 
Jefferson Street, Athens, AL 35611.
    The NRC intends to gather the information necessary to prepare a 
site-specific EIS related to the SLR application for Browns Ferry. The 
site-specific EIS will evaluate the environmental impacts of subsequent 
license renewal for Browns Ferry and reasonable alternatives thereto. 
Possible alternatives to the proposed action include the no action 
alternative and reasonable alternative energy sources. This notice is 
being published in accordance with NEPA and the NRC's regulations at 10 
CFR part 51.
    As part of its environmental review, the NRC will first conduct a 
scoping process for the site-specific EIS and, as soon as practicable 
thereafter, will prepare a draft site-specific EIS for public comment. 
Participation in this scoping process by members of the public and 
local, State, Tribal, and Federal government agencies is encouraged. 
The scoping process for the site-specific EIS will be used to 
accomplish the following:
    a. Define the proposed action that is to be the subject of the 
site-specific EIS;
    b. Determine the scope of the site-specific EIS and identify the 
significant issues to be analyzed in depth;
    c. Identify and eliminate from detailed study those issues that are 
peripheral or are not significant or that have been covered by prior 
environmental review;
    d. Identify any environmental assessments and other ElSs that are 
being or will be prepared that are related to, but are not part of, the 
scope of the site-specific EIS under consideration;
    e. Identify other environmental review and consultation 
requirements related to the proposed action;
    f. Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation 
of the environmental analyses and the NRC's tentative planning and 
decision-making schedule;
    g. Identify any cooperating agencies and, as appropriate, allocate 
assignments for preparation and schedules for completing the site-
specific EIS to the NRC and any cooperating agencies; and
    h. Describe how the site-specific EIS will be prepared, including 
any contractor assistance to be used.
    The NRC invites the following entities to participate in scoping:
    a. The applicant, Tennessee Valley Authority;
    b. Any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or that is 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    c. Affected State and local government agencies, including those

[[Page 23058]]

authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    d. Any affected Indian Tribe;
    e. Any person who requests or has requested an opportunity to 
participate in the scoping process; and
    f. Any person who has petitioned or intends to petition for leave 
to intervene under 10 CFR 2.309.

IV. Public Scoping Meeting

    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.26(b), the scoping process for an EIS 
may include a public scoping meeting to help identify significant 
issues related to the proposed action and to determine the scope of 
issues to be addressed in the EIS.
    The NRC is announcing that it will hold two virtual public scoping 
meetings for the Browns Ferry SLR site-specific EIS. A court reporter 
will transcribe all comments received during the public scoping 
meeting. To be considered, comments must be provided either at a 
transcribed public meeting or in writing, as discussed in the ADDRESSES 
section of this notice. The NRC will hold two virtual public scoping 
meetings on April 11, 2024, at 1 p.m. ET and on April 18, 2024, at 6 
p.m. ET.
    Persons interested in attending this meeting should monitor the 
NRC's Public Meeting Schedule website at https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg 
for additional information and the agenda for the meeting. Please 
contact Ms. Jessica Umana no later than April 6, 2024, for the meeting 
on April 11, 2024, and April 13, 2024, for the meeting on April 18, 
2024, if accommodations or special equipment is needed to attend or to 
provide comments, so that the NRC staff can determine whether the 
request can be accommodated.
    The public scoping meeting will include: (1) an overview by the NRC 
staff of the environmental and safety review processes, the proposed 
scope of the site-specific EIS, and the proposed review schedule; and 
(2) the opportunity for interested government agencies, organizations, 
and individuals to submit comments or suggestions on environmental 
issues or the proposed scope of the Browns Ferry SLR site-specific EIS.
    Participation in the scoping process for the Browns Ferry SLR site-
specific EIS does not entitle participants to become parties to the 
proceeding to which the site-specific EIS relates. Matters related to 
participation in any hearing are outside the scope of matters to be 
discussed at this public meeting.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The NRC staff anticipates the submission of advanced power-reactor 
applications within the next few years based on preapplication 
engagement initiated by several prospective applicants. Because many of 
these

[[Page 23055]]

designs are non-LWRs, the NRC staff developed technology-inclusive, 
risk-informed, performance-based guidance to support the development 
and review of these non-LWR applications. The guidance will facilitate 
the development and review of non-LWR applications for construction 
permits or operating licenses under part 50 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities,'' or combined licenses, manufacturing licenses, 
standard design approval, or design certifications under 10 CFR part 
52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power 
Plants.'' The NRC staff notes it is developing a rule to amend 10 CFR 
parts 50 and 52 to align reactor licensing processes and incorporate 
lessons learned from new reactor licensing into the regulations (RIN 
3150-Al66). This ISG may need to be updated to conform to changes to 10 
CFR parts 50 and 52, if any, adopted through that rulemaking. Further, 
as of the date of this final ISG, the NRC staff is developing an 
optional performance-based, technology-inclusive regulatory framework 
for licensing nuclear power plants designated as 10 CFR part 53 (RIN 
3150-AK31). The NRC intends to revise this guidance as a part of the 
ongoing rulemaking for 10 CFR part 53.
    To standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, 
the NRC staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content 
of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of 
Application Project (TICAP). The ARCAP is an NRC-led activity that is 
intended to result in guidance for a complete non-LWR application for 
review under 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52, and which the NRC staff 
would update, as appropriate, pending the issuance of the 10 CFR part 
50 and 10 CFR part 52 rulemaking as previously mentioned in this 
notice, or if the Commission issues a final 10 CFR part 53 rule. As a 
result, the ARCAP is broad and encompasses several industry-led and 
NRC-led guidance document development activities aimed at facilitating 
a consistent approach to the development of application documents.
    The TICAP is an industry-led activity that is focused on providing 
guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to 
the specific portions of the safety analysis report that describe the 
fundamental safety functions of the design and document the safety 
analysis of the facility using the LMP-based approach. The LMP-based 
approach is described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233, ``Guidance for a 
Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology 
to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML20091L698).
    The ARCAP ISG titled ``Review of Risk-Informed, Technology-
Inclusive Advanced Reactor Applications--Roadmap'' (ARCAP Roadmap ISG) 
was developed to provide a general overview of the information that 
should be included in a non-LWR application. The ARCAP Roadmap ISG also 
provides a review roadmap for the NRC staff with the principal purpose 
of ensuring consistency, quality, and uniformity of NRC staff reviews. 
The ARCAP Roadmap ISG includes references to eight other ARCAP ISGs and 
a TICAP RG that are the subject of separate Federal Register notices 
(FRNs) notifying the public of the issuance of these guidance 
documents. Information regarding the eight other ARCAP ISGs and the 
TICAP RG can be found in the table at the end of the ``Discussion'' 
section.

II. Discussion

    The ARCAP ISG titled, Chapter 10, ``Control of Occupational Dose,'' 
that is the subject of this FRN, was developed because the current 
application and review guidance related to control of occupational 
doses is directly applicable only to light water reactors and may not 
fully (or efficiently) identify the information to be included in a 
technology-inclusive, risk-informed, and performance-based application 
or provide a review approach for such an application.
    The table in this notice provides the document description, ADAMS 
accession number, and, if appropriate, the docket identification 
number.

III. Additional Information

    During the 711th meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor 
Safeguards (ACRS), December 6-7, 2023, the ACRS, the NRC staff, and 
representatives of other stakeholders discussed guidance documents 
related to the ARCAP and the TICAP. On December 20, 2023, the ACRS 
issued a report documenting its review of these guidance documents 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23348A182). The conclusions and recommendations 
in the ACRS report apply to all the ARCAP and TICAP guidance documents. 
In its December 2023 report, the ACRS did not recommend any specific 
changes to DANU-ISG-2022-04.
    Draft DANU-ISG-2022-04, Chapter 10, ``Control of Occupational 
Dose,'' was published in the Federal Register for public comment on May 
25, 2023, (88 FR 33936) with a 45-day comment period. Subsequently, the 
comment period was extended by 30 days as noted in the Federal Register 
dated June 28, 2023 (88 FR 41985). The NRC staff received two public 
comments from stakeholders. The NRC staff's evaluation and resolution 
of the public comments can be found in a document located in ADAMS 
under Accession No. ML23277A151.

IV. Congressional Review Act

    DANU-ISG-2022-04, Chapter 10, ``Control of Occupational Dose,'' is 
a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808). 
However, the Office of Management and Budget has not found it to be a 
major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

V. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    DANU-ISG-2022-04 does not constitute backfitting as defined in 10 
CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in Management Directive 
(MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, 
and Information Requests''; does not constitute forward fitting as that 
term is defined and described in MD 8.4; and does not affect the issue 
finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52. The guidance 
would not apply to any current licensees or applicants or existing or 
requested approvals under 10 CFR part 52, and therefore its issuance 
cannot be a backfit or forward fit or affect issue finality. Further, 
as explained in DANU-ISG-2022-04, applicants and licensees would not be 
required to comply with the positions set forth in DANU-ISG-2022-04.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The NRC staff anticipates the submission of advanced power-reactor 
applications within the next few years based on preapplication 
engagement initiated by several prospective applicants. Because many of 
these designs are non-LWRs, the NRC developed technology-inclusive, 
risk-informed, performance-based guidance to support the development 
and review of these non-LWR applications. The guidance will facilitate 
the development and review of non-LWR applications for construction 
permits or operating licenses under part 50 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities,'' or combined licenses, manufacturing licenses, 
standard design approval, or design certifications under 10 CFR part 
52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power 
Plants.'' The NRC staff notes it is developing a rule to amend 10 CFR 
parts 50 and 52 to align reactor licensing processes and incorporate 
lessons learned from new reactor licensing into the regulations (RIN 
3150-Al66). This ISG may need to be updated to conform to changes to 10 
CFR parts 50 and 52, if any, adopted through that rulemaking. Further, 
as of the date of this final ISG, the NRC staff is developing an 
optional performance-based, technology-inclusive regulatory framework 
for licensing nuclear power plants designated as 10 CFR part 53 (RIN 
3150-AK31). The NRC intends to revise this guidance as a part of the 
ongoing rulemaking for 10 CFR part 53.
    To standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, 
the NRC staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content 
of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of 
Application Project (TICAP). The ARCAP is an NRC-led activity that is 
intended to result in guidance for a complete non-LWR application for 
review under 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52, and which the NRC staff 
would update, as appropriate, pending the issuance of the 10 CFR part 
50 and 10 CFR part 52 rulemaking as previously mentioned in this 
notice, or if the Commission issues a final 10 CFR part 53 rule. As a 
result, the ARCAP is broad and encompasses several industry-led and 
NRC-led guidance document development activities aimed at facilitating 
a consistent approach to the development of application documents.
    The TICAP is an industry-led activity that is focused on providing 
guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to 
the specific portions of the safety analysis report that describe the 
fundamental safety functions of the design and document the safety 
analysis of the facility using the LMP-based approach. The LMP-based 
approach is described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233, ``Guidance for a 
Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology 
to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML20091L698).
    The ARCAP ISG titled ``Review of Risk-Informed, Technology-
Inclusive Advanced Reactor Applications--Roadmap'' (ARCAP Roadmap ISG) 
was developed to provide a general overview of the information that 
should be included in a non-LWR application. The ARCAP Roadmap ISG also 
provides a review roadmap for the NRC staff with the principal purpose 
of ensuring consistency, quality, and uniformity of NRC staff reviews. 
The ARCAP Roadmap ISG includes references to eight other ARCAP ISGs and 
a TICAP RG that are the subject of separate Federal Register notices 
(FRNs) notifying the public of the issuance of these guidance 
documents. Information regarding the eight other ARCAP ISGs and the 
TICAP RG can be found in the table at the end of the ``Discussion'' 
section.

II. Discussion

    The ARCAP ISG titled, Chapter 9, ``Control of Routine Plant 
Radioactive Effluents, Plant Contamination and Solid Waste,'' that is 
the subject of this FRN, was developed because the current application 
and review guidance related to control of routine plant radioactive 
effluents, plant contamination, and solid waste is directly applicable 
only to light water reactors and may not fully (or efficiently) 
identify the information to be included in a technology-inclusive, 
risk-informed, and performance-based application or provide a review 
approach for such an application.
    The table in this notice provides the document description, ADAMS 
accession number, and, if appropriate, the docket identification 
number.

III. Additional Information

    During the 711th meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor 
Safeguards (ACRS), December 6-7, 2023, the ACRS, the NRC staff, and 
representatives of other stakeholders discussed guidance documents 
related to the ARCAP and the TICAP. On December 20, 2023, the ACRS 
issued a report documenting its review of these guidance documents 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23348A182). The conclusions and recommendations 
in the ACRS report apply to all the ARCAP and TICAP guidance documents. 
In its December 2023 report, the ACRS recommended changes to DANU-ISG-
2022-06. As set forth in its letter dated March 18, 2024 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML24024A025) in which the NRC staff responded to the ACRS 
report, the NRC staff considered the ACRS recommendations and, for the 
reasons stated in the staff letter, determined that changes to DANU-
ISG-2022-06 were unnecessary.
    Draft DANU-ISG-2022-06, Chapter 12, ``Post-manufacturing and 
construction Inspection, Testing, and Analysis Program,'' was published 
in the Federal Register for public comment on May 25, 2023, (88 FR 
33920) with a 45-day comment period. Subsequently, the comment period 
was extended by 30 days as noted in the Federal Register dated June 28, 
2023 (88 FR 41987). The NRC staff received nine public comments from 
stakeholders. The NRC staff's evaluation and resolution of the public 
comments can be found in a document located in ADAMS under Accession 
No. ML23277A153.

IV. Congressional Review Act

    DANU-ISG-2022-06, Chapter 12, ``Post-manufacturing and construction 
Inspection, Testing, and Analysis Program,'' is a rule as defined in 
the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of 
Management and Budget has not found it to be a major rule as defined in 
the Congressional Review Act.

V. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    DANU-ISG-2022-06 does not constitute backfitting as defined in 10 
CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in Management Directive 
(MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, 
and Information Requests''; does not constitute forward fitting as that 
term is defined and described in MD 8.4; and does not affect the issue 
finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52. The guidance 
would not apply to any current licensees or applicants or existing or 
requested approvals under 10 CFR part 52, and therefore its issuance 
cannot be a backfit or forward fit or affect issue finality. Further, 
as explained in DANU-ISG-2022-06, applicants and licensees would not be 
required to comply with the positions set forth in DANU-ISG-2022-06.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The NRC staff anticipates the submission of advanced power-reactor 
applications within the next few years based on preapplication 
engagement initiated by several prospective applicants. Because many of 
these designs are non-LWRs, the NRC staff developed technology-
inclusive, risk-informed, performance-based guidance to support the 
development and review of these non-LWR applications. The guidance will 
facilitate the development and review of non-LWR applications for 
construction permits or operating licenses under part 50 of title 10 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities,'' or combined licenses, 
manufacturing licenses, standard design approval, or design 
certifications under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and 
Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants.'' The NRC staff notes it is 
developing a rule to amend 10 CFR parts 50 and 52 to align reactor 
licensing processes and incorporate lessons learned from new reactor 
licensing into the regulations (RIN 3150-Al66). This ISG may need to be 
updated to conform to changes to 10 CFR parts 50 and 52, if any, 
adopted through that rulemaking. Further, as of the date of this final 
ISG, the NRC staff is developing an optional performance-based, 
technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing nuclear power 
plants designated as 10 CFR part 53 (RIN 3150-AK31). The NRC intends to 
revise this guidance as a part of the ongoing rulemaking for 10 CFR 
part 53.
    To standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, 
the NRC staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content 
of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of 
Application Project (TICAP). The ARCAP is an NRC-led activity that is 
intended to result in guidance for a complete non-LWR application for 
review under 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52, and which the NRC staff 
would update, as appropriate, pending the issuance of the 10 CFR part 
50 and 10 CFR part 52 rulemaking as previously mentioned in this 
notice, or if the Commission issues a final 10 CFR part 53 rule. As a 
result, the ARCAP is broad and encompasses several industry-led and 
NRC-led guidance document development activities aimed at facilitating 
a consistent approach to the development of application documents.
    The TICAP is an industry-led activity that is focused on providing 
guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to 
the specific portions of the safety analysis report that describe the 
fundamental safety functions of the design and document the safety 
analysis of the facility using the LMP-based approach. The LMP-based 
approach is described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233, ``Guidance for a 
Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology 
to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML20091L698).
    The ARCAP ISG titled ``Review of Risk-Informed, Technology-
Inclusive Advanced Reactor Applications--Roadmap'' (ARCAP Roadmap ISG) 
was developed to provide a general overview of the information that 
should be included in a non-LWR application. The ARCAP Roadmap ISG also 
provides a review roadmap for the NRC staff with the principal purpose 
of ensuring consistency, quality, and uniformity of NRC staff reviews. 
The ARCAP Roadmap ISG includes references to eight other ARCAP ISGs and 
a TICAP RG that are the subject of separate Federal Register notices 
(FRNs) notifying the public of the issuance of these guidance 
documents. Information regarding the eight other ARCAP ISGs and the 
TICAP RG can be found in the table at the end of the ``Discussion'' 
section.

II. Discussion

    The ARCAP ISG titled, Chapter 11, ``Organization and Human-System 
Considerations,'' that is the subject of this FRN, was developed 
because the current application and review guidance related to 
organization and human-systems interface considerations is directly 
applicable only to light water reactors and may not fully (or 
efficiently) identify the information to be included in a technology-
inclusive, risk-informed, and performance-based application or provide 
a review approach for such an application.
    The table in this notice provides the document description, ADAMS 
accession number, and, if appropriate, the docket identification 
number.

III. Additional Information

    During the 711th meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor 
Safeguards (ACRS), December 6-7, 2023, the ACRS, the NRC staff, and 
representatives of other stakeholders discussed guidance documents 
related to the ARCAP and the TICAP. On December 20, 2023, the ACRS 
issued a report documenting its review of these guidance documents 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23348A182). The conclusions and recommendations 
in the ACRS report apply to all the ARCAP and TICAP guidance documents. 
In its December 2023 report, the ACRS also recommended specific changes 
to DANU-ISG-2022-09. As set forth in its letter dated March 18, 2024 
(ADAMS No. ML24024A025) in which the NRC staff responded to the ACRS 
report, the NRC staff revised DANU-ISG-2022-09 to address specific ACRS 
recommendations.
    Draft DANU-ISG-2022-09, ``Risk-Informed, Performance-Based Fire 
Protection Program (for Operations),'' was published in the Federal 
Register for public comment on May 25, 2023, (88 FR 33922) with a 45-
day comment period. Subsequently, the comment period was extended by 30 
days as noted in the Federal Register dated June 28, 2023 (88 FR 
41990). The NRC staff received twenty-three public comments from 
stakeholders. The NRC staff's evaluation and resolution of the public 
comments can be found in a document located in ADAMS under Accession 
No. ML23277A156.

IV. Congressional Review Act

    DANU-ISG-2022-09, ``Risk-Informed, Performance-Based Fire 
Protection Program (for Operations),'' is a rule as defined in the 
Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of 
Management and Budget has not found it to be a major rule as defined in 
the Congressional Review Act.

V. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    DANU-ISG-2022-09 does not constitute backfitting as defined in 10 
CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in Management Directive 
(MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, 
and Information Requests''; does not constitute forward fitting as that 
term is defined and described in MD 8.4; and does not affect the issue 
finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52. The guidance 
would not apply to any current licensees or applicants or existing or 
requested approvals under 10 CFR part 52, and therefore its issuance 
cannot be a backfit or forward fit or affect issue finality. Further, 
as explained in DANU-ISG-2022-09, applicants and licensees would not be 
required to comply with the positions set forth in DANU-ISG-2022-09.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The NRC staff anticipates the submission of advanced power-reactor 
applications within the next few years based on preapplication 
engagement initiated by several prospective applicants. Because many of 
these designs are non-LWRs, the NRC staff developed technology-
inclusive, risk-informed, performance-based guidance to support the 
development and review of these non-LWR applications. The guidance will 
facilitate the development and review of non-LWR reactor applications 
for construction permits or operating licenses under part 50 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities,'' or combined licenses, 
manufacturing licenses, standard design approval, or design 
certifications under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and 
Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants.'' The NRC staff notes it is 
developing a rule to amend 10 CFR parts 50 and 52 to align reactor 
licensing processes and incorporate lessons learned from new reactor 
licensing into the regulations (RIN 3150-Al66). This ISG may need to be 
updated to conform to changes to 10 CFR parts 50 and 52, if any, 
adopted through that rulemaking. Further, as of the date of this final 
ISG, the NRC staff is developing an optional performance-based, 
technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing nuclear power 
plants designated as 10 CFR part 53 (RIN 3150-AK31). The NRC intends to 
revise this guidance as a part of the ongoing rulemaking for 10 CFR 
part 53.
    To standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, 
the NRC staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content 
of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of 
Application Project (TICAP). The ARCAP is an NRC-led activity that is 
intended to result in guidance for a complete non-LWR application for 
review under 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52, and which the NRC staff 
would update, as appropriate, pending the issuance of the 10 CFR part 
50 and 10 CFR part 52 rulemaking as previously mentioned in this 
notice, or if the Commission issues a final 10 CFR part 53 rule. As a 
result, the ARCAP is broad and encompasses several industry-led and 
NRC-led guidance document development activities aimed at facilitating 
a consistent approach to the development of application documents.
    The TICAP is an industry-led activity that is focused on providing 
guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to 
the specific portions of the safety analysis report that describe the 
fundamental safety functions of the design and document the safety 
analysis of the facility using the LMP-based approach. The LMP-based 
approach is described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233, ``Guidance for a 
Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology 
to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML20091L698).
    The ARCAP ISG titled ``Review of Risk-Informed, Technology-
Inclusive Advanced Reactor Applications--Roadmap'' (ARCAP Roadmap ISG) 
was developed to provide a general overview of the information that 
should be included in a non-LWR application. The ARCAP Roadmap ISG also 
provides a review roadmap for the NRC staff with the principal purpose 
of ensuring consistency, quality, and uniformity of NRC staff reviews. 
The ARCAP Roadmap ISG includes references to eight other ARCAP ISGs and 
a TICAP RG that are the subject of separate Federal Register notices 
(FRNs) notifying the public of the issuance of these guidance 
documents. Information regarding the eight other ARCAP ISGs and the 
TICAP RG can be found in the table at the end of the ``Discussion'' 
section.

II. Discussion

    The ARCAP ISG titled, ``Risk-Informed Inservice Inspection/
Inservice Testing Programs for Non-LWRs,'' that is the subject of this 
FRN, was developed because the current application and review guidance 
related to ISI and IST programs are based on requirements found in 10 
CFR 50.55a, ``Codes and standards,'' that are only applicable to, and 
focus on, large light water reactor (LWR) technologies. In addition, 
the current application and review guidance for large LWR ISI and IST 
programs may not fully (or efficiently) identify the information to be 
included in a technology-inclusive, risk-informed, and performance-
based application or provide a review approach for such an application.
    The table in this notice provides the document description, ADAMS 
accession number, and, if appropriate, the docket identification 
number.

documents. Information regarding the eight other ARCAP ISGs and the 
TICAP RG can be found in the table at the end of the ``Discussion'' 
section.

II. Discussion

    The ARCAP ISG titled, Chapter 2, ``Site Information,'' that is the 
subject of this FRN, was developed because the current application and 
review guidance related to control of site information is directly 
applicable only to light water reactors and may not fully (or 
efficiently) identify the information to be included in a technology-
inclusive, risk-informed, and performance-based application or provide 
a review approach for such an application.
    The table in this notice provides the document description, ADAMS 
accession number, and, if appropriate, the docket identification 
number.

III. Additional Information

    During the 711th meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor 
Safeguards (ACRS), December 6-7, 2023, the ACRS, the NRC staff, and 
representatives of other stakeholders discussed guidance documents 
related to the ARCAP and the TICAP. On December 20, 2023, the ACRS 
issued a report documenting its review of these guidance documents 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23348A182). The conclusions and recommendations 
in the ACRS report apply to all the ARCAP and TICAP guidance documents. 
In its December 2023 report, the ACRS did not recommend any specific 
changes to DANU-ISG-2022-02.
    Draft DANU-ISG-2022-02, Chapter 2, ``Site Information'' was 
published in the Federal Register for public comment on May 25, 2023, 
(88 FR 33940) with a 45-day comment period. Subsequently, the comment 
period was extended by 30 days as noted in the Federal Register dated 
June 28, 2023 (88 FR 41991). The NRC staff received twelve public 
comments from stakeholders. The NRC staff's evaluation and resolution 
of the public comments can be found in a document located in ADAMS 
under Accession No. ML23277A148.

IV. Congressional Review Act

    DANU-ISG-2022-02, Chapter 2, ``Site Information,'' is a rule as 
defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808). However, 
the Office of Management and Budget has not found it to be a major rule 
as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

V. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    DANU-ISG-2022-02 does not constitute backfitting as defined in 10 
CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in Management Directive 
(MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, 
and Information Requests''; does not constitute forward fitting as that 
term is defined and described in MD 8.4; and does not affect the issue 
finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52. The guidance 
would not apply to any current licensees or applicants or existing or 
requested approvals under 10 CFR part 52, and therefore its issuance 
cannot be a backfit or forward fit or affect issue finality. Further, 
as explained in DANU-ISG-2022-02, applicants and licensees would not be 
required to comply with the positions set forth in DANU-ISG-2022-02.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The NRC staff anticipates the submission of advanced power-reactor 
applications within the next few years based on preapplication 
engagement initiated by several prospective applicants. Because many of 
these designs are non-LWRs, the NRC staff developed technology-
inclusive, risk-informed, performance-based guidance to support the 
development and review of these non-LWR applications. The guidance will 
facilitate the development and review of non-LWR applications for 
construction permits or operating licenses under part 50 of title 10 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR),

[[Page 23072]]

``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities,'' or 
combined licenses, manufacturing licenses, standard design approval, or 
design certifications under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, 
and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants.'' The NRC staff notes it is 
developing a rule to amend 10 CFR parts 50 and 52 to align reactor 
licensing processes and incorporate lessons learned from new reactor 
licensing into the regulations (RIN 3150-Al66). This ISG may need to be 
updated to conform to changes to 10 CFR parts 50 and 52, if any, 
adopted through that rulemaking. Further, as of the date of this final 
ISG, the NRC staff is developing an optional performance-based, 
technology-inclusive regulatory framework for licensing nuclear power 
plants designated as 10 CFR part 53 (RIN 3150-AK31). The NRC intends to 
revise this guidance as a part of the ongoing rulemaking for 10 CFR 
part 53.
    To standardize the development of content of a non-LWR application, 
the NRC staff focused on two activities: the Advanced Reactor Content 
of Application Project (ARCAP) and the Technology-Inclusive Content of 
Application Project (TICAP). The ARCAP is an NRC-led activity that is 
intended to result in guidance for a complete non-LWR application for 
review under 10 CFR part 50 or 10 CFR part 52, and which the NRC staff 
would update, as appropriate, pending the issuance of the 10 CFR part 
50 and 10 CFR part 52 rulemaking as previously mentioned in this 
notice, or if the Commission issues a final 10 CFR part 53 rule. As a 
result, the ARCAP is broad and encompasses several industry-led and 
NRC-led guidance document development activities aimed at facilitating 
a consistent approach to the development of application documents.
    The TICAP is an industry-led activity that is focused on providing 
guidance on the appropriate scope and depth of information related to 
the specific portions of the safety analysis report that describe the 
fundamental safety functions of the design and document the safety 
analysis of the facility using the LMP-based approach. The LMP-based 
approach is described in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.233, ``Guidance for a 
Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Methodology 
to Inform the Licensing Basis and Content of Applications for Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light-Water Reactors,'' (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML20091L698).

II. Discussion

    The ARCAP ISG titled, ``Review of Risk-Informed, Technology-
Inclusive Advanced Reactor Applications--Roadmap'' (ARCAP Roadmap ISG), 
that is the subject of this Federal Register notice (FRN), was 
developed to provide a general overview of the information that should 
be included in a non-LWR application. The ARCAP Roadmap ISG also 
provides a review roadmap for the NRC staff with the principal purpose 
of ensuring consistency, quality, and uniformity of NRC staff reviews. 
The ARCAP Roadmap ISG includes references to eight other ARCAP ISGs and 
a TICAP RG that are the subject of separate FRNs notifying the public 
of the issuance of these guidance documents. Information regarding the 
eight other ARCAP ISGs and the TICAP RG can be found in the table at 
the end of this section.
    The table in this notice provides the document description, ADAMS 
accession number, and, if appropriate, the docket identification 
number.

II. Discussion

    The ARCAP ISG titled, ``Risk-Informed Technical Specifications,'' 
that is the subject of this FRN, was developed because the current 
application and review guidance related to technical specifications is 
directly applicable only to light water reactors and may not fully (or 
efficiently) identify the information to be included in a technology-
inclusive, risk-informed, and performance-based application or provide 
a review approach for such an application.
    The table in this notice provides the document description, ADAMS 
accession number, and, if appropriate, the docket identification 
number.

III. Additional Information

    During the 711th meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor 
Safeguards (ACRS), December 6-7, 2023, the ACRS, the NRC staff, and 
representatives of other stakeholders discussed guidance documents 
related to the ARCAP and the TICAP. On December 20, 2023, the ACRS 
issued a report documenting its review of these guidance documents 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23348A182). The conclusions and recommendations 
in the ACRS report apply to all the ARCAP and TICAP guidance documents. 
In its December 2023 report, the ACRS did not recommend any specific 
changes to DANU-ISG-2022-08.
    Draft DANU-ISG-2022-08, ``Risk-Informed Technical Specifications,'' 
was published in the Federal Register for public comment on May 25, 
2023, (88 FR 33926) with a 45-day comment period. Subsequently, the 
comment period was extended by 30 days as noted in the Federal Register 
dated June 28, 2023 (88 FR 41990). The NRC staff received eight public 
comments from stakeholders. The NRC staff's evaluation and resolution 
of the public comments can be found in a document located in ADAMS 
under Accession No. ML23277A155.

IV. Congressional Review Act

    DANU-ISG-2022-08, ``Risk-Informed Technical Specifications,'' is a 
rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808). 
However, the Office of Management and Budget has not found it to be a 
major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

[[Page 23075]]

V. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    DANU-ISG-2022-08 does not constitute backfitting as defined in 10 
CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in Management Directive 
(MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, 
and Information Requests''; does not constitute forward fitting as that 
term is defined and described in MD 8.4; and does not affect the issue 
finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52. The guidance 
would not apply to any current licensees or applicants or existing or 
requested approvals under 10 CFR part 52, and therefore its issuance 
cannot be a backfit or forward fit or affect issue finality. Further, 
as explained in DANU-ISG-2022-08, applicants and licensees would not be 
required to comply with the positions set forth in DANU-ISG-2022-08.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-238; NRC-2024-0060]


United States Maritime Administration; Nuclear Ship Savannah; 
License Termination Plan

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Public meeting and request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: On October 23, 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) received from the United States Maritime Administration (MARAD, 
the licensee) a license amendment request to include a License 
Termination Plan (LTP) for the Nuclear Ship Savannah (NS Savannah). The 
LTP provides details about the known radiological information for the 
ship, the planned demolition and decommissioning tasks to be completed, 
and the final radiological surveys and data that must be obtained for 
termination of the NRC's license for NS Savannah. The NRC is requesting 
public comments on NS Savannah's LTP and will hold a public meeting to 
discuss the LTP.

DATES: The public meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 8, 2024, from 
6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., eastern time (ET), onboard the NS Savannah, 
online, or by phone. The NS Savannah is located at Pier 13 Canton 
Marine Terminal, 4601 Newgate Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21124. The public 
meeting is also available through an online webinar. See Section III

II. Discussion

    The United States Maritime Administration (MARAD, the licensee) is 
the holder of Facility Operating License, NS-1. The license provides, 
among other things, that the Nuclear Ship Savannah (NS Savannah) is 
subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the NRC now or 
hereafter in effect. The NS Savannah is a pressurized water reactor 
ship located in Baltimore, MD.
    The NS Savannah has been shutdown since November 8, 1970, and was

[[Page 23076]]

defueled on December 3, 1971. The licensee started the decommissioning 
process in 1971 in accordance with section 50.82 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Termination of license.'' In 
1973, the U.S Atomic Energy Commission (NRC's predecessor agency) 
issued an amendment placing the reactor in a SAFSTOR condition. SAFSTOR 
is a method of decommissioning in which a nuclear facility is placed 
and maintained in a condition that allows the facility to be safely 
stored and subsequently decontaminated (deferred decontamination) to 
levels that permit release for unrestricted use. In 1976, the 
Possession-only license was issued as required by the 10 CFR 50.82 rule 
that was completely revised in 1996 (61 FR 39278, July 29, 1996).
    The licensee submitted its Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities 
Report (PSDAR), Revision 0, on December 11, 2006 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML063470625) and withdrew Revision 0 by letter dated January 26, 2007 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML18120A039), prior to the NRC scheduling a PSDAR 
public meeting. By letter dated December 11, 2008 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML083590349), the licensee submitted an updated PSDAR, Revision 1, to 
reflect that the there is no intent to immediately dismantle the ship 
itself following license termination. The scope of dismantlement 
described in the PSDAR is based on several fundamental assumptions, (1) 
the ship itself is not dismantled as part of DECON; (2) existing 
accesses are utilized to support dismantlement of systems and 
components; and (3) major structures will not be dismantled. These 
assumptions are based, in part, on National Historic Preservation Act 
requirements and satisfactory final status surveys (FSS). The licensee 
anticipates requesting license termination to be effective in December 
2025, provided all prerequisite actions are complete at that time.
    Based on this, and the fact that the ship is a registered National 
Historic Landmark, the licensee intends to pursue the DECON industrial 
work in a fashion that minimizes any physical affect to adjacent ship 
structure. DECON is a method of decommissioning in which structures, 
systems, and components that contain radioactive contamination are 
actively removed from the site and safely disposed of at a commercially 
operated low-level waste disposal facility or decontaminated to a level 
that permits the site to be released for unrestricted use. DECON may 
occur shortly after cessation of operations, or after a period of 
SAFSTOR. Unlike a land-based nuclear plant, the NS Savannah is 
waterborne, mobile and of unique historic significance, thus its 
decommissioning presents a number of unusual factors for consideration.
    By application dated October 23, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23298A041), the licensee submitted their LTP to the NRC. Paragraph 
50.82(a)(9) specifies that an application for license termination must 
be accompanied or preceded by an LTP, which is subject to NRC review 
and approval. The LTP addresses site characterization to ensure that 
the scope of FSS of the site cover all areas where contamination 
existed, remains, or has the potential to exist or remain, 
identification of remaining dismantlement activities, plans for site 
remediation, a description of the FSS plans to confirm that NS Savannah 
will meet the release criteria in 10 CFR part 20, subpart E, 
``Radiological Criteria for License Termination,'' dose-modeling 
scenarios that ensure compliance with the radiological criteria for 
license termination, an estimate of the remaining site-specific 
decommissioning costs and an updated assessment of the environmental 
effects of decommissioning NS Savannah. Once approved, the LTP would 
become a supplement to the NS Savannah Defueled Safety Analysis Report.
    According to 10 CFR 50.82(a)(9)(iii), after the licensee submits an 
LTP the NRC must hold a public meeting near the site. The purpose of 
the meeting is for the NRC staff to discuss the NRC's review of the LTP 
and to request public comments on the LTP. In addition, in accordance 
with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(9)(iii) and 20.1405, upon the receipt of an LTP 
from a licensee, NRC must publish a notice in the Federal Register and 
solicit comments from affected parties. Please see the related notice 
regarding the LTP proposed no significant hazards consideration 
determination and opportunity to request a hearing and petition to 
intervene (89 FR 22199, March 29, 2024).

III. Request for Comment and Public Meeting

    The NRC is requesting public comments on the NS Savannah LTP. The 
NRC will conduct a public meeting to discuss the LTP and receive 
comments on Wednesday, May 8, 2024, from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., ET 
onboard the NS Savannah, online, or by phone. The NS Savannah is 
located at Pier 13 Canton Marine Terminal, 4601 Newgate Avenue, 
Baltimore, MD 21124. Please contact Tanya E. Hood no later than May 6, 
2024, if accommodations or special equipment are needed for you to 
attend or to provide comments, so that the NRC staff can determine 
whether the request can be accommodated.
    Special services. The NS Savannah is not compliant with the 
Americans with Disabilities Act. The ship has some capability to 
accommodate persons with impaired mobility. For additional information 
regarding the meeting, see the NRC's Public Meeting Schedule website at 
https://meetings.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg. The agenda will be posted no later 
than 10 days prior to the meeting.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 50-269-SLR-2; 50-270-SLR-2; 50-287-SLR-2]


In the Matter of Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, (Oconee Nuclear 
Station Units 1, 2, and 3); Order

    On February 13, 2024, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a 
notice in the Federal Register providing an opportunity to request a 
hearing and petition for leave to intervene with respect to the Draft 
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for Duke Energy Carolinas, 
LLC's subsequent license renewal application for Oconee Nuclear 
Station, Units 1, 2, and 3.\1\ The Federal Register notice set a 
deadline of April 15, 2024, for filing a hearing request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC; Oconee Nuclear Station, Units 1, 
2, and 3; Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, 89 
FR10,107 (Feb. 13, 2024) (Hearing Notice).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Subsequently, on March 18, 2024, Beyond Nuclear and Sierra Club 
(together, Petitioners) filed a motion to extend by two weeks, until 
April 29, 2024, the deadline for Petitioners to request a hearing in 
this proceeding.\2\ The Petitioners represent that the applicant has 
agreed not to oppose this extension request provided that its deadline 
to respond to such a hearing request is also extended by seven days, to 
May 31, 2024.\3\ In addition, the Petitioners state in the motion that 
the NRC Staff has not taken a position on the extension request.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Motion by Beyond Nuclear and Sierra Club for Extension of 
Time to Submit Hearing Request (Mar. 18, 2024) (ADAMS Accession no. 
ML24078A146).
    \3\ Id. at 1.
    \4\ Id. at 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As good cause for the requested extension, the Petitioners cite 
conflicting litigation obligations, a personal commitment, and that 
they ``reasonably anticipated'' that the Commission would withdraw the 
hearing request in light of the circumstances in two other subsequent 
license renewal proceedings.\5\ Under Commission precedent litigation 
burden is not good cause for an extension.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Id. at 1-2. The Petitioners cite subsequent license renewal 
proceedings for North Anna Power Station, Units 1 and 2, and Turkey 
Point Nuclear Generating, Units 3 and 4, the draft supplemental 
environmental impact statements of which were similarly noticed for 
hearing opportunities in accordance with Commission direction. CLI-
22-3, 95 NRC 40, 42 (2022). In the Turkey Point proceeding, the 
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board certified a question to the 
Commission concerning language in CLI-22-3, specifically, whether 
the Staff should have waited to issue the notice of opportunity for 
hearing until the completion of the final supplemental environmental 
impact statement. Florida Power & Light Co. (Turkey Point Nuclear 
Generating Units 3 and 4), LBP-24-1, 99 NRC __, __(Jan. 31, 2024) 
(slip op. at 4). The Commission recently issued an order in which it 
accepted the Board's certification and found the Staff's 
interpretation of CLI-22-3 with respect to the timing of the hearing 
notice acceptable. Florida Power & Light Co. (Turkey Point Nuclear 
Generating Units 3 and 4), CLI-24-1, 99 NRC __, __(Mar. 7, 2024) 
(slip op. at 6).
    \6\ See Consolidated Edison Co. of New York (Indian Point, Units 
1 and 2), CLI-01-8, 53 NRC 225, 229-30 (2001) (quoting Niagara 
Mohawk Power Corp. (Nine Mile Point, Units 1 & 2), 50 NRC 333, 343 
(1999)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Nevertheless, in this instance, the participants have consulted, 
the Petitioners and the applicant have reached agreement, and the 
motion is unopposed. Therefore, pursuant to my authority under 10CFR 
2.346(b), I extend the deadline for all persons to file a hearing 
request in this proceeding until April 29, 2024. The deadline for 
answers to timely hearing requests shall be May 31, 2024, and the 
deadline for any replies shall be June 7, 2024. Petitions to intervene 
and requests for hearing shall be filed consistent with the 
instructions set out in the Electronic Submissions (E-Filing) section 
of the Hearing Notice.
    It is so ordered.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    In SECY-22-0112, ``Proposed Rule: Radioactive Source Security and 
Accountability (3150-AK83; NRC-2022-0103),'' dated December 19, 2022 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML22278A035), the NRC staff provided the 
Commission a proposed rule for approval. The proposed rule would have 
amended regulations in parts 30, 40, and 70 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations to further ensure validity of license applicants. 
The proposed rule also would have required licensees transferring 
category 3 quantities of radioactive material to verify licenses 
through the NRC License Verification System or by contacting the 
license-issuing authority to confirm that the recipient licensee is 
authorized to receive the type, form, and quantity of radioactive 
material to be transferred. Additionally, the proposed rule would have 
required that generally licensed devices containing category 3 
quantities of byproduct material could only be transferred to licensees 
possessing a specific NRC or Agreement State license. The proposed rule 
also would have updated the oral certification method and removed an 
obsolete method of obtaining other sources of information.

II. Discussion

    In the staff requirements memorandum (SRM) for SECY-22-0112, 
``Staff Requirements--SECY-22-0112--Proposed Rule: Radioactive Source 
Security and Accountability (3150-AK83; NRC-2022-0103),'' dated March 
8, 2024, (ADAMS Accession No. ML24068A046), the Commission stated that 
it was ``unable to reach a decision on the staff's recommended proposed 
rule on radioactive source security and accountability that would amend 
regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations to further 
ensure validity of license applicants. Therefore, the proposed rule is 
not approved.'' As directed by the Commission in SRM-SECY-22-0112, the 
NRC will be exploring other rulemaking pathways to update the oral 
certification method and remove the obsolete method of obtaining other 
sources of information.

III. Conclusion

    The NRC is discontinuing the Radioactive Source Security and 
Accountability rulemaking. In the next edition of the Unified Agenda, 
the NRC will update the entry for this rulemaking activity and 
reference this document to indicate that the rulemaking activity is no 
longer being pursued. This rulemaking activity will appear in the 
completed actions section of that edition of the Unified Agenda but 
will not appear in future editions. If the NRC decides to pursue 
similar or related rulemaking activities in the future, it will inform 
the public through new rulemaking entries in the Unified Agenda.

    Dated: March 27, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

II. Background

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
Chapter 35), the NRC is requesting public comment on its intention to 
request the OMB's approval for the information collection summarized 
below.
    1. The title of the information collection: US NRC Acquisition 
Regulation.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0169.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Monthly, once 
(at time of award), and on occasion (when changes occur).
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Contractors and 
bidders.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 6,258 (6,112 reporting 
responses + 146 recordkeepers).
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 428.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 17,412 (14,834 reporting 
+ 2,578 recordkeeping).
    10. Abstract: The mandatory requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission Acquisition Regulation (NRCAR) implement and supplement the 
government-wide Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and ensure that 
the regulations governing the procurement of goods and services with 
the NRC satisfy the needs of the agency. This includes reports and 
recordkeeping requirements for certain contractors or offerors to 
submit a monthly progress report that summarizes work performed during 
the previous month, and/or retain records of equipment, payroll, 
inspection and quality control records, as applicable. Because of 
differing statutory authorities among Federal agencies, the FAR permits 
agencies to issue a regulation to implement FAR policies and procedures 
internally to satisfy the specific need of the agency. The NRCAR 
includes policies, procedures, solicitation provisions and contract 
clauses needed to ensure effective and efficient evaluation, 
negotiation, and administration of agency acquisitions. Certain 
reports, such as reports of

[[Page 22757]]

contractor organizational conflicts of interest or changes in key 
personnel are collected from contractors on as needed basis as changes 
occur whether at the time award or throughout the life of the contract. 
Some reports are required to be submitted monthly such as the Financial 
Status report and Technical Progress Report. There are also some 
reports that bidders are required to submit upon request, such as 
responses to pre-award questions that demonstrate their ability to meet 
minimum standards set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulations.

III. Specific Requests for Comments

    The NRC is seeking comments that address the following questions:
    1. Is the proposed collection of information necessary for the NRC 
to properly perform its functions? Does the information have practical 
utility? Please explain your answer.
    2. Is the estimate of the burden of the information collection 
accurate? Please explain your answer.
    3. Is there a way to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected?
    4. How can the burden of the information collection on respondents 
be minimized, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology?

    Dated: March 28, 2024.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2024-0053]


Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License Involving 
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration and Containing Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information and Order Imposing Procedures 
for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: License amendment request; notice of opportunity to comment, 
request a hearing, and petition for leave to intervene; order imposing 
procedures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is 
considering approval of one amendment request. The amendment request is 
for Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2. For the amendment request, 
the NRC proposes to determine that it involves no significant hazards 
consideration (NSHC). Because the amendment request contains sensitive 
unclassified non-safeguards information (SUNSI), an

[[Page 22752]]

order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI for contention 
preparation by persons who file a hearing request or petition for leave 
to intervene.

or petitions for leave to intervene must be filed by June 3, 2024. Any 
potential party as defined in section 2.4 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) who believes access to Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information and Safeguards Information 
(SUNSI) is necessary to respond to this notice must request document 
access by April 12, 2024.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by any of the following methods, 
however, the NRC encourages electronic comment submission through the 
Federal rulemaking website.
     Federal rulemaking website: Go to https://www.regulations.gov and search for Docket ID NRC-2024-0053. Address 
questions about Docket IDs in Regulations.gov to Stacy Schumann;

II. Background

    Pursuant to Section 189a.(1)-(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), the NRC is publishing this notice. The Act 
requires the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued or 
proposed to be issued and grants the Commission the authority to issue 
and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or 
combined license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission 
that such amendment involves NSHC, notwithstanding the pendency before 
the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.
    This notice includes a notice of amendment containing SUNSI.

III. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of an Amendment to Facility 
Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration 
Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing

    The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following 
amendment request involves NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 
10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance 
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this 
proposed determination for the amendment request is shown as follows.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed 
determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue the license amendment before expiration of the 60-
day period provided that its final determination is that the amendment 
involves no significant hazards consideration. In addition, the 
Commission may issue the amendment prior to the expiration of the 30-
day comment period if circumstances change during the 30-day comment 
period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for 
example, in derating or shutdown of the facility. If the Commission 
takes action on the amendment prior to the expiration of either the 
comment period or the notice period, it will publish a notice of 
issuance in the Federal Register. If the Commission makes a final no 
significant hazards consideration determination for the amendment, any 
hearing on the amendment will take place after issuance. The Commission 
expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

[[Page 22753]]

A. Opportunity to Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 and on the NRC's public website a https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular

[[Page 22754]]

hearing docket. Participants are requested not to include personal 
privacy information such as social security numbers, home addresses, or 
personal phone numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or 
other law requires submission of such information. With respect to 
copyrighted works, except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose 
of the adjudicatory filings and would constitute a Fair Use 
application, participants should not include copyrighted materials in 
their submission.
    The following table provides the plant name, docket numbers, date 
of application, ADAMS accession number, and location in the application 
of the licensee's proposed NSHC determination. For further details with 
respect to this license amendment application, see the application for 
amendment, publicly available portions of which is available for public 
inspection in ADAMS. For additional direction on accessing information 
related to this document, see the ``Obtaining Information and

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards

Information for Contention Preparation; Tennessee Valley Authority; 
Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Rhea County, TN

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI).
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of hearing or 
opportunity for hearing, any potential party who believes access to 
SUNSI is necessary to respond to this notice may request access to 
SUNSI. A ``potential party'' is any person who intends to participate 
as a party by demonstrating standing and filing an admissible 
contention under 10 CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI submitted 
later than 10 days after publication of this notice will not be 
considered absent a showing of good cause for the late filing, 
addressing why the request could not have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemakings and 
Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy General Counsel 
for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the General 
Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001. 
The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both offices is: 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, 
Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the Secretary and 
the Office of the General Counsel are [email protected] and 
[email protected], respectively.\1\ The request must 
include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI under these 
procedures should be submitted as described in this paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice;
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1); and
    (3) The identity of the individual or entity requesting access to 
SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the need for the information in 
order to meaningfully participate in this adjudicatory proceeding. In 
particular, the request must explain why publicly available versions of 
the information requested would not be sufficient to provide the basis 
and specificity for a proffered contention.
    D. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraph C, the NRC staff will determine within 10 days of receipt of 
the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI.
    E. If the NRC staff determines that the requestor satisfies both 
D.(1) and D.(2), the NRC staff will notify the requestor in writing 
that access to SUNSI has been granted. The written notification will 
contain instructions on how the requestor may obtain copies of the 
requested documents, and any other conditions that may apply to access 
to those documents. These conditions may include, but are not limited 
to, the signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or 
Protective Order \2\ setting forth terms and conditions to prevent the 
unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of SUNSI by each individual who 
will be granted access to SUNSI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    F. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 days after 
receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more than 25 
days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) the 
information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of hearing or opportunity for

[[Page 22755]]

hearing), the petitioner may file its SUNSI contentions by that later 
deadline.
    G. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI is denied by the NRC staff 
after a determination on standing and requisite need, the NRC staff 
shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly stating the 
reason or reasons for the denial.
    (2) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination by filing a challenge within 5 days of receipt of that 
determination with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    (3) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    H. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest independent of the proceeding. 
Such a challenge must be filed within 5 days of the notification by the 
NRC staff of its grant of access and must be filed with: (a) the 
presiding officer designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another administrative judge, or an 
Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); 
or (c) if another officer has been designated to rule on information 
access issues, with that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or denying access) is governed by 10 
CFR 2.311.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562; August 3, 2012, 78 FR 34247, June 7, 2013) apply to 
appeals of NRC staff determinations (because they must be served on 
a presiding officer or the Commission, as applicable), but not to 
the initial SUNSI request submitted to the NRC staff under these 
procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests 
for access to SUNSI, and motions for protective orders, in a timely 
fashion in order to minimize any unnecessary delays in identifying 
those petitioners who have standing and who have propounded contentions 
meeting the specificity and basis requirements in 10 CFR part 2. The 
attachment to this Order summarizes the general target schedule for 
processing and resolving requests under these procedures.
    It is so ordered.

    Dated: March 12, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

                                request for access provides a reasonable
                                basis to believe standing can be
                                established and shows need for SUNSI.
                                (NRC staff also informs any party to the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is reviewing an exemption request from Constellation, dated 
February 23, 2024, and supplemented on February 28, 2024, and March 8, 
2024. Constellation is requesting an exemption, pursuant to section 
72.7 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), in 
sections 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11), 
and 72.214 that require Constellation to comply with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, 
Revision No. 1. If approved, the exemption would allow Constellation to 
maintain loaded and to load MPC-68-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System 
at the Dresden ISFSI in a storage condition where the terms, 
conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, 
Revision No. 1, are not met.

II. Environmental Assessment

Background

    Dresden is located on the south bank of the Illinois River at the 
confluence of the Des Plaines and the Kankakee Rivers in Goose Lake 
Township, Grundy County, near the city of Morris, Illinois. Unit 2 
began operating in 1970 and Unit 3 began operating in 1971. 
Constellation has been storing spent fuel in an ISFSI at Dresden under 
a general license as authorized by 10 CFR part 72, subpart K, ``General 
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' 
Constellation currently uses the HI-STORM 100 Cask System under CoC No. 
72-1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1 for dry storage of spent 
nuclear fuel in a specific MPC (i.e., MPC-68M) at the Dresden ISFSI.

Description of the Proposed Action

    The CoC is the NRC approved design for each dry cask storage 
system. The proposed action would exempt the applicant from the 
requirements of 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 
72.212(b)(11), and 72.214 only as these requirements pertain to the use 
of the MPC-68-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System for the already 
loaded systems and the near-term planned loadings of the systems. The 
exemption would allow Constellation to maintain loaded and to load MPC-
68-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System at the Dresden ISFSI, despite 
the MPC-68-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System not being in compliance 
with the terms, conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1014, 
Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1.
    The HI-STORM 100 Cask System CoC provides the requirements, 
conditions, and operating limits necessary for use of the system to 
store spent fuel. Holtec International (Holtec), the designer and 
manufacturer of the HI-STORM 100 Cask System, developed a variant of 
the design with continuous basket shims (CBS) for the MPC-68M, known as 
MPC-68M-CBS. Holtec originally implemented the CBS variant design under 
the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48, which allows licensees to make changes 
to cask designs without a CoC amendment under certain conditions 
(listed in 10 CFR 72.48(c)). After evaluating the specific changes to 
the cask designs, the NRC determined that Holtec erred when it 
implemented the CBS variant design under 10 CFR 72.48, as this was not 
the type of change allowed without a CoC amendment. For this reason, 
the NRC issued three Severity Level IV violations to Holtec. Prior to 
the issuance of the violations, Constellation had already loaded four

[[Page 22464]]

MPC-68M-CBS in a HI-STORM 100 Cask System, which are safely in storage 
on the Dresden ISFSI pad. Additionally, Constellation plans to load one 
MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System in May 2024 and four MPC-
68M-CBS in March 2025. This exemption considers the loading of the 
already loaded systems and the near-term planned loadings of the 
systems with the CBS variant basket design.

Need for the Proposed Action

    Constellation requested this exemption because Constellation is 
currently out of compliance with NRC requirements, resulting from the 
previous loading of spent fuel into a storage system with the CBS 
variant basket design. This exemption would allow four already loaded 
MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System to remain in storage at the 
Dresden ISFSI. The applicant also requested the exemption in order to 
allow Dresden to load MPC-68M-CBS in HI-STORM 100 Cask System at the 
Dresden ISFSI for the future loading campaigns scheduled in May 2024 
and in March 2025.
    Approval of the exemption request would allow Constellation to 
effectively manage the spent fuel pool margin and capacity to enable 
refueling and offloading fuel from the reactor. It would also allow 
Constellation to effectively manage the availability of the specialized 
workforce and equipment needed to support competing fuel loading and 
operational activities at Dresden and other Constellation sites.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    This EA evaluates the potential environmental impacts of granting 
an exemption from the terms, conditions, and specifications in CoC No. 
1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1. The exemption would allow four 
loaded MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System to remain loaded at 
the Dresden ISFSI. The exemption also would allow five additional MPC-
68M-CBS to be loaded in the HI-STORM 100 Cask System in near-term 
loading campaigns and maintained in storage at the Dresden ISFSI.
    The potential environmental impacts of storing spent nuclear fuel 
in NRC-approved storage systems have been documented in previous 
assessments. On July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181), the NRC amended 10 CFR 
part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general 
license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final 
rule analyzed the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved 
storage casks. The EA for the HI-STORM 100 Cask System, CoC No. 1014, 
Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, (80 FR 49887), published in 2015, 
tiers off of the EA issued for the July 18, 1990, final rule. 
``Tiering'' off earlier EAs is a standard process encouraged by the 
regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
(NEPA) that entails the use of impact analyses of previous EAs to bound 
the impacts of a proposed action where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM 
100 Cask System is designed to mitigate the effects of design basis 
accidents that could occur during storage. Considering the specific 
design requirements for the accident conditions, the design of the cask 
would prevent loss of containment, shielding, and criticality control. 
If there is no loss of containment, shielding, or criticality control, 
the environmental impacts would not be significant.
    The exemptions requested by Constellation at the Dresden site as 
they relate to CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1, for the 
HI-STORM 100 Cask System are limited to the use of the CBS variant 
basket design only for the already loaded four systems and near-term 
planned loadings of five systems utilizing the CBS variant basket 
design. The staff has determined that this change in the basket will 
not result in either radiological or non-radiological environmental 
impacts that significantly differ from the environmental impacts 
evaluated in the environmental assessment supporting the issuance of 
CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1. If the exemption is 
granted, there will be no significant change in the types or amounts of 
any effluents released, no significant increase in individual or 
cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure, and no 
significant increase in the potential for or consequences from 
radiological accidents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that 
there would be no significant environmental impacts associated with the 
proposed action.

Alternative to the Proposed Action

    The staff considered the no-action alternative. The no-action 
alternative (denial of the exemption request) would require 
Constellation to unload spent fuel from the MPC-68M-CBS in the HI-STORM 
100 Cask System to bring it in compliance with the CoC terms, 
conditions, and specifications in the CoC No. 1014, Amendment No. 8, 
Revision No. 1. Unloading the cask would subject station personnel to 
additional radiation exposure, generate additional contaminated waste, 
increase the risk of a possible fuel handling accident, and increase 
the risk of a possible heavy load handling accident. Furthermore, the 
removed spent fuel would need to be placed in the spent fuel pool, 
where it would remain until it could be loaded into an approved storage 
cask. Delay in the loading of this spent fuel into other casks could 
affect Constellation's ability to effectively manage the spent fuel 
pool capacity and reactor fuel offloading. Not allowing the two planned 
future loading campaigns could also affect Constellation's ability to 
manage pool capacity, reactor fuel offloading, and refueling. It could 
also pose challenges to spent fuel heat removal and impact the 
availability of the specialized workforce and equipment needed to 
support competing fuel loading and operational activities at Dresden 
and other Constellation sites. The NRC has determined that the no-
action alternative would result in undue potential human health and 
safety impacts that could be avoided by proceeding with the proposed 
exemption, especially given that the staff has concluded in NRC's 
Safety Determination Memorandum, issued with respect to the enforcement 
action against Holtec regarding these violations, that fuel can be 
stored safety in the MPC-68M-CBS casks.

Agencies Consulted

    The NRC provided the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and 
Office of Homeland Security (IL IEMA-OHS) a copy of this draft EA for 
review by an email dated March 15, 2024. On March 22, 2024, IL-IEMA-OHS 
provided its concurrence by email.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action have been reviewed 
in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement 
NEPA. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the NRC finds 
that the proposed action of granting the exemption from the regulations 
in 10 CFR 72.212(a)(2), 72.212(b)(3), 72.212(b)(5)(i), 72.212(b)(11) 
and 72.214, which require the licensee to comply with the terms, 
conditions, and specifications of the CoC, in this case limited to past 
and specific future loadings of baskets with the CBS variant design, 
would not significantly impact the quality of the human environment. 
Accordingly, the NRC has determined that a finding of no significant 
impact (FONSI) is appropriate, and an environmental impact statement is 
not warranted.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket Nos. 50-309 and 72-30; NRC-2024-0020]


Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company; Maine Yankee Atomic Power 
Station; Exemption

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued an 
exemption in response to the March 31, 2023, request from Maine Yankee 
Atomic Power Company (MYAPC or Maine Yankee), for the Maine Yankee 
Atomic Power Station (MYAPS), located in Wiscasset, Maine. The 
exemption permits MYAPC to make withdrawals from a separate account 
within Maine Yankee's overall Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), on 
an annual basis, for spent nuclear fuel and Greater than Class C (GTCC) 
waste management and non-radiological site restoration without prior 
notification to the NRC.

DATES: The exemption was issued on February 29, 2024.

Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, 
DC 20555-0001; telephone: 404-997-4730, email: [email protected].

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By letter dated March 31, 2023, (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML23113A005), the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company 
(MYAPC or Maine Yankee) submitted a request to the NRC for an exemption 
from sections 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) of title 10 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) for the Maine Yankee Independent Spent 
Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI).\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Maine Yankee ISFSI sits on the former site of the Maine 
Yankee Atomic Power Station, which MYAPC finished decommissioning in 
2005. Although only the Maine Yankee ISFSI remains on the site, 
Maine Yankee's 10 CFR part 50 license, Facility Operating License 
No. DPR-36, remains in effect. Because MYAPC requested an exemption 
from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, this would be an exemption 
for MYAPC's 10 CFR part 50 license rather than for MYAPC's 10 CFR 
part 72 general license. Therefore, although MYAPC's submission 
requested an exemption for the Maine Yankee ISFSI, the NRC considers 
it a request for an exemption for the Maine Yankee Atomic Power 
Station.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Maine Yankee has established a separate (segregated) account within 
its over-arching Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT), entitled ``ISFSI 
Radiological Decom,'' that identifies the funds for radiological 
decommissioning of the ISFSI apart from the larger balance of funds in 
the NDT allocated for ongoing management of spent nuclear fuel and 
Greater than Class C (GTCC) waste and for non-radiological site 
restoration activities. Although 10 CFR 50.82 applies to the segregated 
account, it does not apply to the overall NDT.
    The exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) allows 
MYAPC to make withdrawals from the segregated account, on an annual 
basis, for spent nuclear fuel and GTCC waste management and non-
radiological site restoration without prior notification to the NRC. 
More specifically, with this exemption, MYAPC can annually transfer 
funds exceeding 110 percent of the inflation-adjusted Decommissioning 
Cost Estimate, described in 10 CFR 50.75, from the segregated account 
to its overarching NDT and use those funds for spent nuclear fuel and 
GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration.
    Based on the review, the NRC determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue 
risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common 
defense and security. Also, the NRC determined that special 
circumstances are present. Therefore, the NRC granted Maine Yankee an 
exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(2) to permit MYAPC to make withdrawals from the segregated 
account, on an annual basis, for spent nuclear fuel and GTCC waste 
management and non-radiological site restoration without prior 
notification to the NRC. All other relevant

[[Page 22463]]

requirements shall be met. On February 29, 2024, the NRC issued an 
exemption for MYAPC (ADAMS Package Accession No. ML23286A325). The NRC 
staff also prepared an environmental assessment and finding of no 
significant impact regarding the proposed exemption request, published 
in the Federal Register on February 28, 2024 (89 FR 14723), and 
concluded that the proposed exemption would not have a significant 
impact on the quality of the human environment.

II. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility 
Operating

[[Page 22200]]

License No. NS-1 regarding the NS Savannah, located in Baltimore City, 
Maryland. On October 23, 2023, the NRC received a license amendment 
request to add a license condition to include the requirements of an 
LTP for the NS Savannah. The LTP provides details about the known 
radiological information for the ship, the planned demolition and 
decommissioning tasks to be completed, and the final radiological 
surveys and data that must be obtained for termination of the NRC's 
license for NS Savannah.
    Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the NRC will 
need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and NRC's regulations.
    The NRC has made a proposed determination that the license 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under 
the NRC's regulations in section 50.92 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), this means that operation of the facility 
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or 
(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required 
by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue 
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
    1. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not 
involve modification of any plant equipment or affect basic plant 
operation. The license termination submittal requests the NRC approve a 
proposed license change document, the LTP, and revisions to it. The 
document is a detailed plan of how MARAD will satisfy the criteria to 
allow NRC to terminate the NSS [NS Savannah] license. The NSS reactor 
is not operational, all reactor fuel has been removed from the site 
since 1971 and the level of radioactivity in the NSS has significantly 
decreased from the levels that existed when the 1976 Possession-only 
License was issued. All safety-related systems are deactivated, 
disabled, drained and perform no active function. No aspect of the 
proposed change is an initiator of any accident previously evaluated. 
Consequently, the probability of an accident previously evaluated is 
not significantly increased. Therefore, the proposed change does not 
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated.
    2. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed change is administrative in nature and does not 
involve physical alteration of plant equipment that was not previously 
allowed by the License or Technical Specifications. The proposed change 
does not change the method by which any safety-related system performs 
its function. All safety-related systems are deactivated, disabled, 
drained and perform no active function. No new or different types of 
equipment will be installed. The reactor will remain permanently 
shutdown and defueled. Therefore, the proposed change does not create 
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated.
    3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety?
    Response: No.
    The proposed change is administrative in nature. NRC approval of 
the proposed change will have no effect on margins of safety relevant 
to the ship's defueled and partially dismantled primary and auxiliary 
reactor systems. As such, no change is being made to safety analysis 
assumptions, safety limits or safety system settings that would 
adversely affect plant safety as a result of the proposed change. The 
proposed change only involves requesting NRC approval of the LTP and 
revisions to it. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety.
    The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on 
this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration.
    The NRC is seeking public comments on this proposed determination 
that the license amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue the license amendment before expiration of the 60-
day notice period if the Commission concludes the amendment involves no 
significant hazards consideration. In addition, the Commission may 
issue the amendment prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment 
period if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such 
that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in 
derating or shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action 
prior to the expiration of either the comment period or the notice 
period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. 
If the Commission makes a final no significant hazards consideration 
determination, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very 
infrequently.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place

[[Page 22201]]

after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions and E-Filing

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    For further details with respect to this action, see the 
application for license amendment dated October 23, 2023 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML23298A041).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of partial exemptions, pursuant to 
section 73.5 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
``Specific exemptions,'' from the physical barrier requirement of 10 
CFR 73.2, specifically with respect to the design criteria specified in 
10 CFR 73.2, ``Physical barrier,'' paragraph 1, as it applies to the 
angular specification for brackets used to support the required barbed 
wire (or similar material) topper. These partial exemptions would be 
issued to SNC for Hatch, Units 1 and 2, Farley, Units 1 and 2, and 
Vogtle, Units 1, 2, 3, and 4, in Appling County, Georgia, Houston 
County, Alabama, and Burke County, Georgia, respectively.
    Prior environmental reviews include NUREG-1437, ``Generic 
Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants,'' 
Supplement 4--Final Report (ADAMS Package Accession No. ML011590310), 
regarding Hatch, Units 1 and 2, published in May 2001; NUREG-1437, 
``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear 
Plants,'' Supplement 18--Final Report (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML050680297), regarding Farley, Units 1 and 2, published in March 2005; 
NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License 
Renewal of Nuclear Plants,'' Supplement 34--Final Report (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML083380325), regarding Vogtle, Units 1 and 2, published 
in December 2008; and NUREG-1947, ``Final Supplemental Environmental 
Impact Statement for Combined License (COLs) for Vogtle Electric 
Generating Plant Unit 3 and 4'' Final Report (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML11076A010) published in March 2011.
    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC has prepared an 
environmental assessment (EA) that analyzes the environmental effects 
of the proposed action. Based on the results of the EA and in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.31(a), the NRC has prepared a FONSI for the 
proposed exemption.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would grant the licensee partial exemption from 
the physical barrier requirement of 10 CFR 73.2, specifically with 
respect to the design criteria specified in 10 CFR 73.2, ``Physical 
barrier,'' paragraph 1, as it applies to the angular specification for 
brackets used to support the required barbed wire (or similar material) 
topper. As stated in 10 CFR 73.2, fences must be constructed of No. 11 
American wire gauge, or heavier wire fabric, topped by three strands or 
more of barbed wire or similar material on brackets angled inward or 
outward between 30 and 45 degrees from the vertical, with an overall 
height of not less than eight feet, including the barbed topping. If 
approved, the partial exemption would allow the licensee to continue to 
use, without modification, the current configuration of vertical barbed 
wire fence toppings in limited protected area sections on-site, as 
specified on the maps submitted by the licensee in its exemption 
application dated July 7, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23188A163), as 
supplemented by letters dated February 5 and 12, 2024 (ML24036A292 and 
ML24043A186, respectively), to meet the regulatory requirements of 10 
CFR part 73, ``Physical protection of plants and materials.'' 
Specifically, barbed wire on top of physical barrier fencing on gates, 
near gates, near interfaces with buildings, and on corners is oriented 
vertically.

Need for the Proposed Action

    Physical protection consists of a variety of measures to protect 
nuclear facilities and material against sabotage, theft, diversion, and 
other malicious acts. The NRC and its licensees use a graded approach 
for physical protection, consistent with the significance of the 
facilities or material to be protected. In so doing, the NRC 
establishes the regulatory requirements and assesses compliance, and 
licensees are responsible for providing the protection.
    Since design criteria in 10 CFR 73.2 require the barbed wire fence 
toppings to be angled, the proposed action is needed to allow the 
licensee to continue to use, without modification, the current 
configuration of vertical barbed wire fence toppings in certain limited 
protected area sections on-site.
    Separate from this EA, the NRC staff is evaluating the licensee's 
proposed

[[Page 21288]]

action, which will be documented in staff evaluation reports for each 
site. The NRC staff's review will determine whether there is reasonable 
assurance that the SNC Fleet maintains adequate protection with the 
current physical barriers in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR 
part 73.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC has completed its environmental evaluation of the proposed 
action. The proposed action would grant the licensee partial exemption 
from the design criteria specified in 10 CFR 73.2, ``Physical 
barrier,'' paragraph 1, as it applies to the angular specification for 
brackets used to support the required barbed wire (or similar material) 
topper. This will allow the licensee to continue using vertical, rather 
than angled, barbed wire fence toppings in certain limited protected 
area sections at the SNC Fleet sites.
    The proposed action would have no direct impacts on land use or 
water resources. Impacts to terrestrial and aquatic biota would be 
negligible as the proposed action involves no new construction or 
modification of plant operational systems. There would be no changes to 
the quality or quantity of non-radiological effluents. No changes to 
the plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit are 
needed. In addition, there would be no noticeable effect on air 
pollutant emissions, socio-economic conditions in the region, no 
environment justice impacts, and no impacts to historic and cultural 
resources. Therefore, there would be no significant non-radiological 
impacts associated with the proposed action.
    The NRC has concluded that the proposed action would not have a 
significant adverse effect on the probability of an accident occurring. 
There would be no change to radioactive effluents that affect radiation 
exposures to plant workers and members of the public. No changes would 
be made to plant buildings or the site property. Therefore, 
implementing the proposed action would not result in a change to the 
radiation exposures to the public or radiation exposure to plant 
workers.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC considered denial 
of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). Denial of 
the exemption request would result in the licensee having to replace 
the vertical barbed wire fence toppings with angled barbed wire that 
meets the definition of ``Physical barrier'' in 10 CFR 73.2. This could 
result in temporary, minor changes in vehicular traffic and associated 
air pollutant emissions due to any construction-related impacts of 
performing the necessary modifications, but no significant changes in 
ambient air quality would be expected.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    The NRC staff did not enter into consultation with any other 
Federal agency or with the States of Georgia and Alabama regarding the 
environmental impact of the proposed action.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The licensee has requested exemptions from the physical barrier 
requirement of 10 CFR 73.2, specifically with respect to the design 
criteria specified in 10 CFR 73.2, ``Physical barrier,'' paragraph 1, 
to allow the licensee to continue using vertical, rather than angled, 
barbed wire fence toppings in limited protected area sections on site. 
The NRC is considering issuing the requested exemption. The proposed 
action would not have a significant adverse effect on the probability 
of an accident occurring and would not have any significant 
radiological and non-radiological impacts. This FONSI incorporates by 
reference the EA in Section II of this notice. Based on the EA, the NRC 
concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect 
on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has 
determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the 
proposed action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Discussion

    The NRC is issuing a revision in the NRC's ``Regulatory Guide'' 
series. This series was developed to describe methods that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the 
agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff uses in 
evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to describe 
information that the staff needs in its review of applications for 
permits and licenses.
    The proposed Revision 1 to RG 1.234 was issued with a temporary 
identification of Draft Regulatory Guide, (DG)-1416 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML23187A549). This revision of this guide (Revision 1) clarifies 
the NRC's definition of counterfeit, fraudulent, and suspect items. In 
addition, the staff made several editorial changes to conform to the 
current format and content of RGs.

Additional Information

    The NRC published a notice of the availability of DG-1416 in the 
Federal Register on November 17, 2023 (88 FR 80196) for a 30-day public 
comment period. The public comment period closed on December 18, 2023. 
No public comments on DG-1416 were received.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under chapter 
I of title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

Congressional Review Act

    This RG is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of RG 1.234, Revision 1, does not constitute backfitting 
as defined in 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC 
Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward 
Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information Requests''; affect issue 
finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants''; or constitute 
forward fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 8.4, 
because, as explained in RG 1.234, Revision 1, licensees are not 
required to comply with the positions set forth in the RG.

Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    During the period from February 1, 2024, to February 29, 2024, the 
NRC granted 13 exemptions in response to requests submitted by the 
following licensees: Dominion Energy South Carolina, Inc.; DTE Electric 
Company; Duke Energy Progress, LLC/Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC; Entergy 
Operations, Inc.; Florida Power & Light Company; Nebraska Public Power 
District; Union Electric Company, doing business as Ameren Missouri; 
Virginia Electric and Power Company; and Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating 
Corporation.
    These exemptions temporarily allow the licensee to deviate from 
certain requirements of part 73 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,'' 
subpart T, ``Security Notifications, Reports, and Recordkeeping.'' In 
support of its exemption requests, the licensees agreed to effect site-
specific administrative controls that maintain the approach to 
complying with 10 CFR part 73 in effect prior to the NRC's issuance of 
a final rule, ``Enhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and 
Security Event Notifications,'' which was published in the Federal 
Register on March 14, 2023, and became effective on April 13, 2023 (88 
FR 15864).

II. Availability of Documents

    The tables in this notice provide transparency regarding the number 
and

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, NRC 
Form 483, ``Registration Certificate--In Vitro Testing With Byproduct 
Material Under General License.'' The NRC hereby informs potential 
respondents that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and that a 
person is not required to respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on October 27, 2023, 88 FR 73881.
    1. The title of the information collection: NRC Form 483, 
Registration Certificate--In Vitro Testing With Byproduct Material 
Under General License.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0038.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: NRC Form 483.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: There is a 
one-time submittal of information to receive a validated copy of the 
NRC Form 483 with an assigned registration number. In addition, any 
changes in the information reported on the NRC Form 483 must be 
reported in writing to the NRC within 30 days after the effective date 
of the change.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Any physician, 
veterinarian in the practice of veterinary medicine, clinical 
laboratory, or hospital which desires a general license to receive, 
acquire, possess, transfer, or use specified units of byproduct 
material in certain in vitro clinical or laboratory tests.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 6.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 3.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 0.65 hours (0.5 hours 
reporting + 0.15 hours recordkeeping).
    10. Abstract: Section 31.11 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), established a general license authorizing any 
physician, clinical laboratory, veterinarian in the practice of 
veterinary medicine, or hospital to possess certain small quantities of 
byproduct material for in vitro clinical or laboratory tests not 
involving the internal or external administration of the byproduct 
material or the radiation therefrom to human beings or animals. 
Possession of byproduct material under 10 CFR 31.11 is not authorized 
until the physician, clinical laboratory, veterinarian in the practice 
of veterinary medicine, or hospital has filed the NRC Form 483 and 
received from the Commission a validated copy of the NRC Form 483 with 
a registration number. The licensee can use the validated copy of the 
NRC Form 483 to obtain byproduct material from a specifically licensed 
supplier. The NRC incorporates this information into a database which 
is used to verify that a general licensee is authorized to receive the 
byproduct material.

    Dated: March 18, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC received a subsequent license renewal application (SLRA) 
from TVA, dated January 19, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. ML24019A010), 
filed pursuant to section 103 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and part 54 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses 
for Nuclear Power Plants,'' requesting the renewal of the operating 
licenses for BFN at 3,952 megawatts thermal for each unit. The BFN 
units are boiling-water reactors designed by General Electric and are 
located in Athens, Alabama. A notice of receipt of the SLRA was 
published in the Federal Register on February 8, 2024, (89 FR 8725).
    The NRC staff has determined that TVA has submitted sufficient 
information in accordance with 10 CFR 54.19, 54.21, 54.22, 54.23, 
51.45, and 51.53(c), to enable the staff to undertake a review of the 
application, and that the application is, therefore, acceptable for 
docketing. The current docket nos. 50-259, 50-260, and 50-296 for 
Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33, DPR-52, and DPR-68, 
will be retained. The determination to accept the SLRA for docketing 
does not constitute a determination that a subsequent renewed license 
should be issued and does not preclude the NRC staff from requesting 
additional information as the review proceeds.
    Before issuance of the requested subsequent renewed licenses, the 
NRC will have made the findings required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations. In accordance with 10 CFR 54.29, 
the NRC may issue a subsequent renewed license on the basis of its 
review if it finds that actions have been identified and have been or 
will be taken with respect to: (1) managing the effects of aging during 
the period of extended operation on the functionality of structures and 
components that have been identified as requiring aging management 
review; and (2) time-limited aging analyses that have been identified 
as requiring review, such that there is reasonable assurance that the 
activities authorized by the renewed license will continue to be 
conducted in accordance with the current licensing basis and that any 
changes made to the plant's current licensing basis will comply with 
the Act and the Commission's regulations.
    Additionally, in accordance with 10 CFR 51.95(c), the NRC staff 
will prepare an environmental impact statement as a supplement to the 
Commission's NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for 
License Renewal of Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated June 2013 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML13106A241). In considering the SLRA, the Commission 
must find that the applicable requirements of subpart A of 10 CFR part 
51 have been satisfied, and that any matters raised under 10 CFR 2.335 
have been addressed. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.26, and as part of the 
environmental scoping process, the staff intends to hold public scoping 
meetings. Detailed information regarding the environmental scoping 
meetings will be the subject of a separate Federal Register notice.

II. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

III. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires

[[Page 20256]]

participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    Detailed information about the license renewal process can be found 
under the Reactor License Renewal section on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal.html. 
Copies of the application to renew the operating license for BFN are 
available for public inspection at the NRC's PDR, and on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications.html. The application may be accessed in ADAMS 
through the NRC Library on the internet at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html under ADAMS Accession No. ML24019A010. As previously 
stated, persons who do not have access to ADAMS or who encounter 
problems in accessing the documents located in ADAMS may contact the 
NRC's PDR reference staff by telephone at 1-800-397-4209 or 301-415-
4737, or by email to [email protected].

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2024-0056]


Monthly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating 
Licenses and Combined Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards 
Considerations

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Monthly notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 189.a.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended (the Act), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) is publishing this regular monthly notice. The Act requires the 
Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to 
be issued, and grants the Commission the authority to issue and make

publicly disclosed in their comment submission. Your request should 
state that the NRC does not routinely edit comment submissions to 
remove such information before making the comment submissions available 
to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses and Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination

    For the facility-specific amendment requests shown in this notice, 
the Commission finds that the licensees' analyses provided, consistent 
with section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) ``Notice for public comment; State consultation,'' are sufficient 
to support the proposed determinations that these amendment requests 
involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, 
operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments 
would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves NSHC. In addition, the Commission may issue any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period 
if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that 
failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or 
shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice 
of issuance. If the Commission makes a final NSHC determination for any 
of these amendments, any hearing will take place after issuance. The 
Commission expects that the need to take action on any amendment before 
60 days have elapsed will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave to Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent

[[Page 19609]]

a determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.

III. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Combined Licenses

    During the period since publication of the last monthly notice, the 
Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has 
determined for each of these amendments that the application complies 
with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The 
Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    A notice of consideration of issuance of amendment to facility 
operating license or combined license, as applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing in connection with these 
actions, were published in the Federal Register as indicated in the 
safety evaluation for each amendment.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that 
these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.22(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to each action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession numbers for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing 
Regulatory Guide (RG) 3.25, Revision 1, ``Standard Format and Content 
of Safety Analysis Reports for Uranium Enrichment Facilities.'' This RG 
Revision is being withdrawn because it only refers to NUREG-1520, 
``Standard Review Plan for the Review of a License Application for a 
Fuel Cycle Facility,'' which provides guidance on the subject matter to 
applicants and NRC staff reviewers.

DATES: The effective date of the withdrawal of RG 3.25, Revision 1, is 
March 19, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Discussion

    The NRC is withdrawing RG 3.25, Revision 1, ``Standard Format and 
Content of Safety Analysis Reports for Uranium Enrichment Facilities.'' 
RG 3.25, Revision 1, provided guidance on the standard format and 
content of a safety analysis report (SAR) for uranium enrichment 
facilities and related documents submitted as part of an application to 
construct or modify and operate a nuclear fuel cycle facility. This RG 
revision endorsed the standard format and content for SARs and 
integrated safety analysis (ISA) summaries described in NUREG-1520, 
``Standard Review Plan for the Review of a License Application for a 
Fuel Cycle Facility,'' as a process that the NRC staff found acceptable 
for meeting the regulatory requirements. Applicants use NUREG-1520 
while developing fuel cycle facility applications, and NRC staff use 
NUREG-1520 while reviewing these applications.
    NUREG-1520 provides current guidance to applicants and NRC staff 
reviewers on the acceptable content and format of SARs and ISA 
summaries. Therefore, the NRC determined that RG 3.25, Revision 1 is no 
longer needed to simply refer to NUREG-1520 and is being withdrawn. 
Revision 0 of RG 3.25 is also still available but is not the most 
recent acceptable guidance for developing and reviewing these license 
applications.
    The withdrawal of RG 3.25, Revision 1, does not alter any prior or 
existing NRC licensing approval or the acceptability of licensee 
commitments to RG 3.25, Revision1. Although RG 3.25, Revision 1 is 
withdrawn, current licensees may continue to use it and withdrawal does 
not affect any existing licenses or agreements. However, RG 3.25, 
Revision 1 should not be used in future requests or applications for 
NRC licensing actions. The NRC is considering the withdrawal of RG 
3.25, Revision 0.

Additional Information

    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under chapter 
I of title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering 
whether to issue a construction permit (CP) to Abilene Christian 
University (ACU) to authorize the construction of a proposed non-power 
molten salt research reactor (MSRR). The MSRR would be an up to 1 
megawatt-thermal, graphite moderated, fluoride salt flowing fluid (fuel 
dissolved in the salt) research reactor that would be located in the 
existing Gayle and Max Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center 
(SERC) building on the ACU campus in Abilene, Texas. The NRC has 
prepared this environmental assessment (EA) and finding of no 
significant impact (FONSI) that considers the impacts associated with 
issuing the CP.

DATES: The EA and FONSI referenced in this document are available on 
March 14, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    By application dated August 12, 2022, as supplemented by letters 
dated October 14, 2022, September 27, 2023, and November 14, 2023, ACU 
submitted, pursuant to section 104c of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended, and part 50 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization 
Facilities,'' a CP application for the MSRR. A notice of receipt and 
availability of the CP application was published in the Federal 
Register (FR) on October 14, 2022 (87 FR 62463). A notice of the 
acceptability for docketing of the CP application was published in the 
FR on November 28, 2022 (87 FR 73051) as was a January 31, 2023, notice 
of opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(88 FR 6319). The NRC has prepared an EA as part of its review of the 
CP application in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR part 51, 
``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic Licensing and 
Related Regulatory Functions.'' Based on the results of the EA, the NRC 
has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) 
and is issuing a FONSI.

[[Page 18679]]

II. Environmental Assessment

    The NRC issuance of a CP would constitute an authorization for ACU 
to proceed with the construction of the MSRR in the existing SERC 
building on the ACU campus in Abilene, Texas. The need for the MSRR is 
to conduct research on molten salt reactor technology. This would help 
to further the research of ACU's Nuclear Energy eXperimental Testing 
Laboratory whose mission is to seek solutions to the world's need for 
energy, water, and medical isotopes by advancing the technology of 
molten salt reactors while educating future leaders in nuclear science 
and engineering. The MSRR would not produce electricity and would be 
the first university-based molten salt research reactor.
    In the EA, the NRC staff assessed the potential direct and indirect 
environmental impacts from the proposed action associated with the 
following relevant resource areas: land use and visual resources; air 
quality and noise; hydrogeology and water resources; ecological 
resources; historic and cultural resources; socioeconomics and 
environmental justice; human health; nonradiological waste management; 
uranium fuel cycle and radiological waste management; transportation of 
radioactive material; postulated accidents; and climate change. The NRC 
staff also considered the cumulative impacts from past, present, and 
reasonably foreseeable future actions when combined with the proposed 
action. The NRC staff identified alternatives to the proposed action 
and the environmental impacts of the alternatives as appropriate. The 
NRC staff determined that the environmental impacts of the proposed 
action would be SMALL for each potentially affected environmental 
resource, meaning that the environmental effects are not detectable or 
are so minor that they will neither destabilize nor noticeably alter 
any important attribute of the resource. The NRC staff also determined 
that there are no alternatives that meet the need for the proposed 
action and that are environmentally preferrable to the proposed action.
    The issuance of a CP is a separate licensing action from the 
issuance of an operating license (OL). If the NRC issues a CP for the 
MSRR and ACU were to seek NRC approval to operate the MSRR, then ACU 
would have to submit a separate application for an OL pursuant to the 
NRC's regulations, and ACU would have to obtain NRC approval before it 
could operate the MSRR. The NRC staff would review any application for 
an OL for the MSRR for new and significant information related to the 
environmental impacts of operating and decommissioning the MSRR that 
might alter the staff's conclusions made in the EA for the CP 
application.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    As required by 10 CFR 51.21, ``Criteria for and identification of 
licensing and regulatory actions requiring environmental assessments,'' 
the NRC prepared the EA. On the basis of the EA, the NRC concluded that 
the proposed action will not have a significant impact on the quality 
of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined, pursuant 
to 10 CFR 51.31, ``Determinations based on environmental assessment,'' 
not to prepare an EIS for the proposed action.

IV. Availability of Documents

    The following table identifies the EA and FONSI and related 
documents. The documents are available for public inspection online 
through ADAMS at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html at the 
listed accession numbers.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 72-10; NRC-2023-0155]


Northern States Power Company; Prairie Island Independent Spent 
Fuel Storage Installation; License Amendment Application

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviewed an 
application by Northern States Power Company (NSPM) for amendment of 
Special Nuclear Materials License No. SNM-2506 which authorizes NSPM to 
receive, possess, store, and transfer spent nuclear fuel and associated 
radioactive materials. The amendment request sought to revise the 
technical specifications (TS) for the Prairie Island Independent Spent 
Fuel Storage Installation (PI ISFSI) to allow use of a Code alternative 
as an option to the requirements of the 2004 Edition through 2006 
Addenda of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler 
and Pressure Vessel (B&PV) Code, Section III, Division 1, Subsection 
NB, Paragraph NB-5130, by revising the TS to add the Code alternative 
to TS section 4.4, table 4.4-1, TN-40HT ASME Code Exceptions.

DATES: The license amendment was issued March 5, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John-Chau Nguyen, Office of Nuclear 
Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555-0001; telephone: 301-415-0262; email: [email protected].

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NRC received, by letter dated July 14, 
2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23195A187), a license amendment application 
from NSPM, to amend Special Nuclear Materials License No. SNM-2506, 
which authorizes the storage of spent fuel at the PI ISFSI located in 
Welch, Minnesota. Specifically, the amendment sought to revise the TS 
to allow use of a Code alternative as an option to the requirements of 
the 2004 Edition through 2006 Addenda of the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (B&PV) Code, 
Section III, Division 1, Subsection NB, Paragraph NB-5130, by revising 
the TS to add the Code alternative to TS section 4.4, table 4.4-1, TN-
40HT ASME Code Exceptions.
    An NRC administrative completeness review, documented in a letter 
to NSPM dated August 24, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23234A135), found 
the application acceptable to begin a technical review. In accordance 
with section 72.16 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR), a notice of docketing was published in the Federal Register on 
September 8, 2023 (88 FR 62108). The notice of docketing included an 
opportunity to request a hearing and to petition for leave to 
intervene. No requests for a hearing or petitions for leave to 
intervene were submitted.
    The NRC prepared a safety evaluation report (SER) (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML24008A131) to document its review and evaluation of the amendment 
request. In addition, the NRC evaluated an assertion by NSPM that the 
amendment request satisfied the categorical exclusion criteria 
specified in 10 CFR 51.22(c)(11). Under 10 CFR 51.22(c)(11), a 
categorical exclusion is allowed for amendments to materials licenses 
which are administrative, organizational, or procedural in nature, or 
which result in a change to process operations or equipment, provided 
that (i) there is no significant change in the types or significant 
increase in the amounts of any effluents that may be released offsite, 
(ii) there is no significant increase in individual or cumulative 
occupational radiation exposure, (iii) there is no significant 
construction impact, and (iv) there is no significant increase in the 
potential for or consequences from radiological accidents. As explained 
in the SER, the NRC determined that the license amendment satisfied the 
10 CFR 51.22(c)(11) categorical exclusion criteria. Consequently, an 
environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are not 
required.
    Upon completing its review, the NRC staff determined that the 
request complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), as well as the NRC's rules 
and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate

[[Page 18681]]

findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and 
regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set forth in the license 
amendment. The NRC approved and issued Amendment No. 12 to Special 
Nuclear Materials License No. SNM-2506 (ML24008A130), held by NSPM for 
the receipt, possession, transfer, and storage of spent fuel and 
associated radioactive materials at the PI ISFSI. Pursuant to 10 CFR 
72.46(d), the NRC is providing notice of the action taken. Amendment 
No. 12 was effective as of the date of issuance, March 5, 2024.

    Dated: March 11, 2024.

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Notices, Instructions, and Reports to Workers: Inspection and 
Investigations.'' The NRC hereby informs potential respondents that an 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and that a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-0320; NRC-2024-0050]


Draft Programmatic Agreement: TMI-2SOLUTIONS, LLC; Three Mile 
Island Nuclear Station, Unit No. 2

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; request for comment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is requesting 
comment on a draft Programmatic Agreement (PA) between the NRC, 
Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), and TMI-2 
Energy Solutions (TMI-2Solutions). The purpose of this draft PA is to 
resolve any adverse effects to historic properties identified during 
consultation for a license amendment request for the Three Mile Island 
Nuclear Station, Unit No. 2 (TMI-2), located in Londonderry Township, 
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. TMI-2Solutions will be engaging in 
certain major decommissioning activities, including the physical 
demolition of buildings previously deemed eligible for the National 
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Because the impacts on the historic 
properties from these decommissioning activities have not been 
previously evaluated and are not bounded by NUREG-0586, ``Final Generic 
Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) on Decommissioning of Nuclear 
Facilities'', the NRC initiated consultation under the National 
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). During the NHPA section 106 
consultation, it was determined that there would be adverse effects to 
historic properties and a PA was developed to address resolution of 
adverse effects.

DATES: Submit comments by April 5, 2024. Comments received after this 
date will be considered if it is practical to do so, but the NRC is 
able to ensure consideration only for comments received on or before 
this date.

ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by any of the following methods; 
however, the NRC encourages electronic comment submission through the 
Federal rulemaking website:
     Federal rulemaking website: Go to https://www.regulations.gov and search for Docket ID NRC-2024-0050. Address 
questions about Docket IDs to Stacy Schumann; telephone: 301-415-0624;

submissions available to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated February 22, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23058A064), TMI-2Solutions requested an amendment to Possession Only 
License No. DPR-73. TMI-2Solutions will be engaging in certain major 
decommissioning activities, including the physical demolition of 
buildings previously deemed eligible for the National Register of 
Historic Places (NRHP). Paragraph 50.82(a)(6)(ii) of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) states that licensees shall not 
perform any decommissioning activities that would result in significant 
environmental impacts that have not been previously reviewed. Adverse 
impacts, such as certain alterations or demolition to structures that 
have been deemed eligible for listing on the NRHP, could be considered 
unreviewed significant environmental impacts under 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(6)(ii). Because the impacts on the historic properties from 
TMI-2Solutions' proposed decommissioning activities have not been 
previously evaluated, TMI-2Solutions requested an amendment to evaluate 
the impacts of the decommissioning activities on the NRHP-eligible 
properties.
    The NRC uses its National Environmental Policy Act process for 
developing environmental assessments (EAs) to facilitate consultation 
under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), 
pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8.
    The NRC met with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, the 
Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), TMI-
2Solutions, and other consulting parties to discuss how to address the 
adverse effects to historic properties. The parties agreed to develop a 
PA to resolve any adverse effects. As explained in the PA, once the 
agreement is executed, the NRC will become the lead agency for 
implementation of the PA.
    The draft PA addresses the potential direct and indirect adverse 
effects from the decommissioning activities and ensures that 
appropriate mitigation measures are implemented. The NRC's final EA 
will include the final PA and therefore conclude NHPA section 106 
consultation.

III. Request for Public Comment

    The NRC is requesting public comment on the draft PA. The NRC will 
consider these comments before finalizing the PA, which will be 
published as an appendix in the final EA. The draft PA is available in 
ADAMS under Accession No. ML24044A184.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Introduction

    During the period from January 1, 2024, to January 31, 2024, the 
NRC granted 22 exemptions in response to requests submitted by the 
following licensees: Constellation Energy Generation, LLC; Duke Energy; 
NextEra Energy Point Beach, LLC and NextEra Energy Seabrook, LLC; 
Indiana Michigan Power Company; PSEG Nuclear LLC; Northern States Power 
Company, a Minesota Corporation, doing business as Xcel Energy; Entergy 
Operations, Inc.; and Southern Nuclear Operating Company.
    These exemptions temporarily allow the licensees to deviate from 
certain requirements of part 73 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,'' 
subpart T, ``Security Notifications, Reports, and Recordkeeping.'' In 
support of its exemption requests, the licensees agreed to effect site-
specific administrative controls that maintain the approach to 
complying with 10 CFR part 73 in effect prior to the NRC's issuance of 
a final rule, ``Enhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and 
Security Event Notifications,'' which was published in the Federal 
Register on March 14, 2023, and became effective on April 13, 2023 (88 
FR 15864).

II. Availability of Documents

    The tables in this notice provide transparency regarding the number 
and type of exemptions the NRC has issued and provides the licensee 
name, facility name, docket number, document description, document

II. Background

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
chapter 35), the NRC is requesting public comment on its intention to 
request the OMB's approval for the information collection summarized 
below.
    1. The title of the information collection: Voluntary Reporting of 
Performance Indicators.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0195.
    3. Type of submission: Revision.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Quarterly for 
Performance Indicator reporting and, on occasion, for the Frequently 
Asked Question process.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Power reactor 
licensees.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 400 (379 reporting 
responses + 21 recordkeepers).
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 94.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: The total reporting and 
recordkeeping burden is 82,034 (80,960 hours reporting + 1,074 hours 
recordkeeping).
    10. Abstract: As part of a joint industry-NRC initiative, the NRC 
receives information submitted voluntarily by power reactor licensees 
regarding selected performance attributes known as performance 
indicators (PIs). PIs are objective measures of the performance of 
licensee systems or programs. The NRC uses PI information and 
inspection results in its Reactor Oversight Process (ROP) to make 
decisions about plant performance and regulatory response. Licensees 
transmit PIs electronically to reduce burden on themselves and the NRC. 
Licensees also participate in the ROP Performance Indicator Frequently 
Asked Question (FAQ) process that it is used to resolve interpretation 
issues with Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) document, NEI 99-02, 
``Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guideline.'' The ROP PI 
FAQ process and white papers may also be used to propose changes to NEI 
99-02 guidance and the PI Program. The NRC and industry review FAQs and 
white papers and work to achieve resolution during periodic public 
meetings.

III. Specific Requests for Comments

    The NRC is seeking comments that address the following questions:
    1. Is the proposed collection of information necessary for the NRC 
to properly perform its functions? Does the information have practical 
utility? Please explain your answer.
    2. Is the estimate of the burden of the information collection 
accurate? Please explain your answer.
    3. Is there a way to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected?
    4. How can the burden of the information collection on respondents 
be minimized, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology?

    Dated: February 29, 2024.

II. Background

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
chapter 35), the NRC is requesting public comment on its intention to 
request the OMB's approval for the information collection summarized 
below.
    1. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR part 61, License 
Requirements for Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0135.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Applications 
for licenses are submitted as needed. Other reports are submitted 
annually, and as other events require.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond? Applicants for and 
holders of an NRC license or Agreement State license for land disposal 
of low-level radioactive waste.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 16 (12 reporting 
responses and 4 recordkeepers).
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 4.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 5,372 hours (56 hours 
reporting and 5,316 hours recordkeeping).
    10. Abstract: 10 CFR part 61, establishes the procedures, criteria,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing a revision in the NRC's ``Regulatory Guide'' 
series. This series was developed to describe methods that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the 
agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff uses in 
evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to describe 
information that the staff needs in its review of applications for 
permits and licenses.
    The proposed Revision 4 to RG 4.7 was issued with a temporary 
identification of Draft Regulatory Guide (DG)-4034. The NRC staff 
revised RG 4.7 to include alternative approaches to the population-
density criterion and to expand the regulatory guidance developed for 
large light-water reactor (LWR) technology with appropriate 
modifications for advanced reactor designs (e.g., non-LWR technologies 
and light-water small modular reactors). Specifically, this revision 
includes a new appendix A, which implements the Commission approved 
alternative population-related criteria in SRM-SECY-20-0045 
``Population-Related Siting Considerations for Advanced Reactors,'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML22194A885). Appendix A provides guidance on 
alternatives to the existing guidance in section C.1.4 of this RG that 
establishes a fixed distance of 20 miles out to which population 
density is assessed for any new application. Readers should understand 
that the body of this RG was developed for large LWRs, while appendix A 
is intended for advanced reactor designs. This revision also removes 
repetition and improves clarity. Text from the discussion section and 
the two tables in Revision 3 to the RG were brought together in Section 
C, ``Staff Regulatory Guidance.'' To present each topic in Section C 
cohesively, the document was structured to list (1) relevant statutes 
and regulations, (2) related guidance, and (3) considerations, 
regulatory experience, and staff positions.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC published a notice of the availability of DG-4034 in the 
Federal Register on October 18, 2023 (88 FR 71777) for a 30-day public 
comment period. The public comment period closed on November 17, 2023. 
Public comments on DG-4034 and the staff responses to the public 
comments are available in ADAMS under Accession No. ML23324A007.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under chapter 
I of title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

III. Congressional Review Act

    This RG is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of this RG does not constitute backfitting as defined in 
10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC Management 
Directive

[[Page 14744]]

(MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, 
and Information Requests,'' would not affect the issue finality of any 
approval issued under 10 CFR part 52; and would not constitute forward 
fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 8.4. This RG will 
not apply to any construction permits, operating licenses, early site 
permits, limited work authorizations issued under 10 CFR 50.10, or 
combined licenses, for which the NRC issued a final environmental 
impact statement (EIS) preceded by a draft EIS under 10 CFR 51.76 or 
51.75, any of which were issued by the NRC prior to issuance of this 
final RG. The NRC has already completed its siting determination for 
those construction permits, operating licenses, early site permits, 
limited work authorizations, and combined licenses. Therefore, no 
further NRC regulatory action on siting will occur for those licenses, 
permits, and authorizations, for which the guidance in the RG would be 
relevant. The methods described in this RG will be used in evaluating 
applications for construction permits, early site permits, combined 
operating licenses and limited work authorizations, which includes 
information under 10 CFR 51.49(b) or (f), with respect to compliance 
with applicable regulations governing the siting of new nuclear power 
plants and testing facilities, unless the applicant proposes an 
acceptable alternative method for complying with those regulations. 
Methods that differ from those described in this RG may be deemed 
acceptable if the applicant provides sufficient basis and information 
for the NRC staff to verify that the proposed alternative complies with 
the applicable NRC regulations.

V. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

B. Submitting Comments

    The NRC encourages electronic comment submission through the 
Federal rulemaking website (https://www.regulations.gov). Please 
include Docket ID NRC-2024-0036 in your comment submission.
    The NRC cautions you not to include identifying or contact 
information that you do not want to be publicly disclosed in your 
comment submission. The NRC will post all comment submissions at 
https://www.regulations.gov as well as enter the comment submissions 
into ADAMS. The NRC does not routinely edit comment submissions to 
remove identifying or contact information.
    If you are requesting or aggregating comments from other persons 
for submission to the NRC, then you should inform those persons not to 
include identifying or contact information that they do not want to be 
publicly disclosed in their comment submission. Your request should 
state that the NRC does not routinely edit comment submissions to 
remove such information before making the comment submissions available 
to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC is issuing for public comment a DG in the NRC's 
``Regulatory Guide'' series. This series was developed to describe 
methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific 
parts of the agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff 
uses in evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to 
describe information that the staff needs in its review of applications 
for permits and licenses.
    The DG, entitled ``Preparing Probabilistic Fracture Mechanics 
Submittals,'' is temporarily identified by its task number, DG-1422 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23291A298).
    This DG presents proposed guidance on justifying the acceptability 
of the methods used to generate and report PFM results. This DG does 
not describe how the results of PFM may be used to support a regulatory 
application. Regulatory applications typically contain information 
other than fracture mechanics analyses; this DG does not address the 
review of this other information. The proposed revisions made to RG 
1.245, Revision 0 clarify guidance for applications that leverage risk 
insights, such as PFM. These changes are reflected in Regulatory 
Positions 2.1, ``Regulatory Context,'' and

[[Page 14783]]

2.2, ``Information Made Available to the NRC Staff with a Probabilistic 
Fracture Mechanics Submittal.''
    The staff is also issuing for public comment a draft regulatory 
analysis (ADAMS Accession No. ML23291A299). The staff developed the 
regulatory analysis to assess the value of revising RG 1.245, Revision 
0, as well as alternative courses of action.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Proposed Rules'' section of 
the Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under 
chapter I of title 1 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

III. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of DG-1422, if finalized, would not constitute backfitting 
as defined in 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC 
Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward 
Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information Requests''; affect issue 
finality of any approval issued under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, 
Certificates, and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants''; or constitute 
forward fitting as defined in MD 8.4, because, as explained in this DG, 
licensees would not be required to comply with the positions set forth 
in this DG.

IV. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

II. Background

    In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 
Chapter 35), the NRC is requesting public comment on its intention to 
request the OMB's approval for the information collection summarized 
below.
    1. The title of the information collection: Generic Clearance for 
the Collection of Qualitative Feedback on Agency Service Delivery.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0217.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: On occasion 
and annually.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Individuals and 
households; businesses and organizations; State, Local, or Tribal 
governments.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 13,300.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 13,300.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 2,708.
    10. Abstract: The information collection activity will garner 
qualitative customer and stakeholder feedback in an efficient, timely 
manner, for the purpose of improving service delivery. By qualitative 
feedback we mean information that provides useful insights on 
perceptions and opinions, but are not statistical surveys that yield 
quantitative results that can be generalized to the population of 
study. This feedback will provide insights into customer or stakeholder 
perceptions, experiences and expectations, provide an early warning of 
issues with service, or focus attention on areas where communication, 
training or changes in operations might improve delivery of products or 
services. These collections will allow for ongoing, collaborative and 
actionable communications between the Agency and its customers and 
stakeholders. It will also allow feedback to contribute directly to the 
improvement of program management. Feedback collected under this 
generic clearance will provide useful information, but it will not 
yield data that can be generalized to the overall population. This type 
of generic clearance for qualitative information will not be used for 
quantitative information collections that are designed to yield 
reliably actionable results, such as monitoring trends over time or 
documenting program performance. Such data uses require more rigorous 
designs that address: the target population to which generalizations 
will be made, the sampling frame, the sample design (including 
stratification and clustering), the precision requirements or power 
calculations that justify the proposed sample size, the expected 
response rate, methods for assessing potential nonresponse bias, the 
protocols for data collection, and any testing procedures that were or 
will be undertaken prior to fielding the study. Depending on the degree 
of influence the results are likely to have, such collections may still 
be eligible for submission for other generic

[[Page 14727]]

mechanisms that are designed to yield quantitative results.

III. Specific Requests for Comments

    The NRC is seeking comments that address the following questions:
    1. Is the proposed collection of information necessary for the NRC 
to properly perform its functions? Does the information have practical 
utility? Please explain your answer.
    2. Is the estimate of the burden of the information collection 
accurate? Please explain your answer.
    3. Is there a way to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected?
    4. How can the burden of the information collection on respondents 
be minimized, including the use of automated collection techniques or 
other forms of information technology?

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    By letter dated March 31, 2023, Maine Yankee submitted a request to 
the NRC for an exemption from paragraphs 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 
50.75(h)(2) of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) for 
the Maine Yankee Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation 
(ISFSI).\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ As discussed in the referenced EA, the Maine Yankee ISFSI 
sits on the former site of the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station, 
which MYAPC finished decommissioning in 2005. Although only the 
Maine Yankee ISFSI remains on the site, Maine Yankee's 10 CFR part 
50 license, Facility Operating License No. DPR-36 remains in effect. 
Because the MYAPC requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 
CFR part 50, this would be an exemption for MYAPC's 10 CFR part 50 
license rather than for MYAPC's 10 CFR part 72 general license. 
Therefore, although MYAPC's submission requested an exemption for 
the Maine Yankee ISFSI, the NRC staff will consider it a request for 
an exemption for the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Maine Yankee has established a separate (segregated) account within 
its over-arching nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT), entitled ``ISFSI 
Radiological Decom,'' that identifies the funds for radiological 
decommissioning of the ISFSI apart from the larger balance of funds in 
the NDT allocated for ongoing management of spent nuclear fuel and 
Greater than Class C (GTCC) waste and for non-radiological site 
restoration activities. Although 10 CFR 50.82 applies to the segregated 
account, it does not apply to the overall NDT.
    If granted, the exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 
50.75(h)(2) would permit MYAPC to make withdrawals from the segregated 
account, on an annual basis, for spent fuel and GTCC waste management 
and non-radiological site restoration without prior notification to the 
NRC. More specifically, with this exemption, MYAPC would be able to 
annually transfer funds exceeding 110 percent of the inflation-adjusted 
decommissioning cost estimate, described in 10 CFR 50.75, from the 
segregated account to its overarching NDT and use those funds for spent 
fuel and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration.
    Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station began commercial operation in 
December 1972, and shut down in December 1996. Maine Yankee began 
decommissioning the Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station in 1998. After 
ceasing reactor operations, MYAPC began transferring spent nuclear fuel 
(SNF) from the spent fuel pool to the Maine Yankee ISFSI for long-term 
dry storage. MYAPC completed these activities in 2004 and completed its 
final decommissioning of the reactor site, except for the ISFSI, which 
included dismantling and removing all reactor-related facilities, in 
2005. As a result, only the ISFSI remains at the old plant site of 
Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station in Wiscasset, Maine. By letter dated 
September 30, 2005 (ADAMS Package Accession No. ML052380223), the NRC 
issued Amendment No. 172 to Facility Operating License No. DPR-36 to 
allow MYAPC to possess and store SNF at the permanently shut down and 
decommissioned facility under the provisions of 10 CFR part 72, subpart 
K, ``General License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor 
Sites.''
    The NRC staff is performing both a safety evaluation and an 
environmental review to determine whether to grant this exemption 
request. The NRC staff will prepare a separate safety evaluation report 
(SER) to document its safety review and analysis. The NRC's SER will 
evaluate the proposed exemption to ensure reasonable assurance of 
adequate protection of public health and safety, and the common defense 
and security. This EA documents the environmental

[[Page 14724]]

review which the NRC staff prepared in accordance with 10 CFR 51.21 and 
51.30(a). The NRC's decision whether to grant the exemption will be 
based on the results of the NRC staff's review as documented in this 
EA, and the staff's safety review to be documented in the SER.

II. Environmental Assessment

    By letter dated March 31, 2023, Maine Yankee submitted a request to 
the NRC for an exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(2). If granted, the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) would permit MYAPC to make 
withdrawals from the segregated account, on an annual basis, for SNF 
and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site restoration without 
prior notification to the NRC. More specifically, with this exemption, 
MYAPC would be able to annually transfer funds exceeding 110 percent of 
the inflation-adjusted decommissioning cost estimate, described in 10 
CFR 50.75, from the segregated account to its overarching NDT and use 
those funds for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site 
restoration activities.

Need for the Proposed Action

    As required by 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A), decommissioning trust 
funds may be used by the licensee if the withdrawals are for legitimate 
decommissioning activity expenses, consistent with the definition of 
decommissioning in 10 CFR 50.2. This definition addresses radiological 
decommissioning and does not include activities associated with 
management of SNF and GTCC waste or non-radiological site restoration. 
Similarly, the requirements of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) restrict the use of 
decommissioning trust fund disbursements (other than for ordinary and 
incidental expenses) to decommissioning expenses until final 
decommissioning has been completed.
    Maine Yankee stated that it has established a segregated account, 
entitled ``ISFSI Radiological Decom,'' within its over-arching NDT, 
that identifies the funds for radiological decommissioning of the 
ISFSI. This segregated account is separate from the larger balance of 
funds in the NDT allocated for ongoing management of SNF and GTCC waste 
and for other non-radiological site restoration activities. Therefore, 
exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 50.75(h)(2) is needed to 
allow Maine Yankee to use funds from the segregated account for of SNF 
and GTCC waste management and other non-radiological site restoration 
activities.
    In its Decommissioning Funding Assurance Status Report dated March 
6, 2023, Maine Yankee stated that, as of December 31, 2022, its 
inflation-adjusted decommissioning cost estimate (DCE) for the 
radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI, is approximately $7.4 
million in 2022 dollars, which, it asserted provides reasonable 
assurance of adequate funding to complete the NRC-required 
decommissioning activities. In the same report, Maine Yankee reported 
that the segregated ``ISFSI Radiological Decom'' account had $56.4 
million. More specifically, in its exemption request, Maine Yankee 
provided a table showing $7,436,375 in 2022 dollars as the inflation-
adjusted DCE. Maine Yankee's exemption request further stated that the 
segregated account has a balance of $56,449,354 as of December 31, 
2022, meaning that the segregated account had a balance of $49,012,979, 
or 659 percent beyond the inflation-adjusted DCE.
    Maine Yankee stated that, if the exemption is granted, funds in its 
segregated account which exceed 110 percent of the inflation-adjusted 
DCE for the radiological decommissioning of the ISFSI would be 
transferred to the overarching NDT on an annual basis without prior NRC 
notification. Maine Yankee would then use those funds for SNF and GTCC 
waste management and non-radiological site restoration, which in turn, 
would allow Maine Yankee to return its additional excess funds in the 
overarching NDT to its customers as part of future rate cases with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
    The requirements of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) further provide that, except 
for withdrawals being made under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) or for payments of 
ordinary administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the NDT 
in connection with the operation of the NDT, no disbursement may be 
made from the NDT without written notice to the NRC at least 30 working 
days in advance. Therefore, an exemption from 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) is 
also needed to allow Maine Yankee to use funds from the segregated 
account for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site 
restoration activities without prior NRC notification.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action involves an exemption from requirements that 
are of financial and/or administrative nature and that do not have an 
impact on the environment.
    Before the NRC could approve the proposed action, it would have to 
conclude that there is reasonable assurance that adequate funds are 
available in the segregated account to complete all activities 
associated with radiological decommissioning as well as SNF and GTCC 
waste management and non-radiological site restoration. Therefore, 
there would be no decrease in safety associated with the use of funds 
from the segregated account to also fund activities associated with SNF 
and GTCC waste management and non-radiological site-restoration.
    The requested exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2), if approved, would allow 
transfers on an annual basis. Maine Yankee stated that it will continue 
to provide its annual decommissioning funding assurance status report 
in accordance with the 10 CFR 50.75(f)(1) and (2) and 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(v) and (vi) requirements. These reports provide the NRC 
staff with awareness of, and the ability to act on, any actual or 
potential funding deficiencies. As the proposed exemption would not 
affect these requirements, the NRC staff would have tools available for 
any potential funding deficiencies. Since the exemption would allow 
Maine Yankee to use funds from the segregated account that are in 
excess of those required for radiological decommissioning, the adequacy 
of funds dedicated for radiological decommissioning would not be 
affected by the proposed exemption. Therefore, there is reasonable 
assurance that there would be no environmental impact due to lack of 
adequate funding for radiological decommissioning.
    Further, there are no new accident precursors created by using the 
excess funds from the segregated account for SNF and GTCC waste 
management and non-radiological site-restoration. The exemption, if 
granted, would be financial and/or administrative in nature. Thus, the 
probability of postulated accidents is not increased. Also, the 
consequences of postulated accidents are not increased. No changes are 
being made in the types or amounts of effluents that may be released 
offsite. There is no significant increase in occupational or public 
radiation exposure. Therefore, the requested exemption will not present 
an undue risk to the public health and safety.
    With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed 
action would have no direct impacts on land use or water resources, 
including terrestrial and aquatic biota, as it involves no new 
construction or modification of plant operational

[[Page 14725]]

systems. There would be no changes to the quality or quantity of non-
radiological effluents. In addition, there would be no noticeable 
effect on socioeconomic conditions in the region, no environmental 
justice impacts, no air quality impacts, and no impacts to historic and 
cultural resources from the proposed action. Therefore, there are no 
significant non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the 
proposed action.
    For these reasons, the NRC concludes there are no significant 
environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption request.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    In addition to the proposed action, the NRC staff also considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Denial of the exemption request would result in no change in current 
environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action 
and the alternative action would be similar.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies Consulted

    By email dated January 16, 2024, the NRC provided a copy of this 
draft EA to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, 
Radiological Control Program, for review. By email dated January 30, 
2024, Maine Department of Health & Human Services concurred with the 
NRC staff's determination.

Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultation

    Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), 
requires Federal agencies to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service or National Marine Fisheries Service regarding actions that may 
affect listed species or designated critical habitats. The ESA is 
intended to prevent further decline of endangered and threatened 
species and restore those species and their critical habitat.
    The NRC staff determined that a consultation under section 7 of the 
ESA is not required because the proposed action will not affect listed 
species or critical habitat.

National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Consultation

    Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) 
requires Federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings 
on historic properties. As stated in the NHPA, historic properties are 
any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or 
object included in, or eligible for inclusion in the National Register 
of Historic Places.
    The NRC determined that the scope of activities described in this 
exemption request do not have the potential to cause effects on 
historic properties because the NRC's approval of this exemption 
request will not authorize new construction or land disturbance 
activities. The NRC staff also determined that the proposed action is 
not a type of activity that has the potential to impact historic 
properties because the proposed action would occur within the 
established Maine Yankee site boundary. Therefore, in accordance with 
36 CFR 800.3(a)(1), no consultation is required under section 106 of 
NHPA.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The environmental impacts of the proposed action--an exemption from 
the requirements of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(2) 
allowing MYAPC to make withdrawals from the segregated account, on an 
annual basis, for SNF and GTCC waste management and non-radiological 
site restoration without prior notification to the NRC--have been 
reviewed under the requirements in 10 CFR part 51, which implement the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
    The proposed exemption would not have a significant adverse effect 
on the probability of an accident occurring and would not have any 
significant radiological or non-radiological impacts. The proposed 
exemption involves an exemption from requirements that are of a 
financial and/or administrative nature and would not have an impact on 
the human environment. Consistent with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC conducted 
the EA for the proposed exemption, and this FONSI incorporates by 
reference the EA in Section II of this document. Therefore, the NRC 
concludes that the proposed action will not have significant effects on 
the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has 
determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the 
proposed action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating 
License Nos. NPF-90 and NPF-96, issued to TVA, for the operation of 
Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, located in Rhea County, Tennessee. Therefore, 
as required by section 51.21, ``Criteria for and identification of 
licensing and regulatory actions requiring environmental assessments,'' 
of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), the NRC 
performed an EA that analyzes the environmental impacts of the proposed 
licensing action and alternatives as appropriate. Based on the results 
of the EA that follows, and in accordance with 10 CFR 51.31(a), the NRC 
has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the 
proposed licensing action and is issuing a FONSI.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would revise Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, TS 4.2.1 
to increase the limit on the maximum number of TPBARs that can be 
irradiated in the reactor core in an operating cycle from 1,792 to 
2,496. The proposed action would also revise Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, 
TS 5.9.6 to add supporting methodologies. Additionally, the proposed 
action would revise the Watts Bar Dual-Unit Updated Final Safety 
Analysis Report to modify the source term for design basis accident 
analyses to allow the core fission product inventory to be calculated 
using an updated version of the ORIGEN computer code.
    The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's 
application dated March 20, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23079A270).

Need for the Proposed Action

    The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and TVA are cooperating in a 
program to produce tritium for the National Security Stockpile by 
irradiating TPBARs in the Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, reactor cores. 
Tritium is produced when the neutrons produced by nuclear fission in 
the core are absorbed by the lithium target material of the TPBARs. A 
solid zirconium metal cladding covering the TPBARs (called a 
``getter'') captures the tritium produced.
    This proposed action is needed to support the DOE, National Nuclear 
Security Administration, National Security Stockpile, in accordance 
with Public Law (Pub. L.) 106-65. Section 3134 of Public Law 106-65 
directs the Secretary of Energy to produce new tritium at Watts Bar. By 
letters dated July 29, 2016 (ADAMS Accession No. ML16159A057), and May 
22, 2019 (ADAMS Accession No. ML18347B330), the NRC approved similar 
amendments to irradiate up to 1,792 TPBARs in the Watts Bar reactor 
cores. The EA and FONSI for those licensing actions, completed on June 
23, 2016, and February 6, 2019, can be found in ADAMS under Accession 
Nos. ML16138A045 and ML18332A013, respectively.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff has assessed the potential environmental impacts from 
the proposed increase in the maximum number of TPBARs that can be 
irradiated in the Watts Bar reactor cores.
    The non-radiological and radiological impacts on the environment 
that may result from the proposed action are summarized as follows.
Non-Radiological Impacts
    The proposed action involves no new construction or modification of 
Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, operational systems and would have no direct 
impact on land and water use or water quality, including terrestrial 
and aquatic biota. There would also be no change in the quality or 
quantity of non-radiological effluents and no need to modify the 
nuclear plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. 
The proposed action would have no effect on air pollutant emissions or 
ambient air quality. In addition, the proposed action would have no 
noticeable effect on socioeconomic and environmental justice conditions 
in the region, and no adverse effect on historic and cultural 
resources. Therefore, the proposed action would have no significant 
non-radiological effect on the quality of the human environment.
Radiological Impacts
    All nuclear power plants, including Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, 
release small amounts of radioactive material to the environment as 
liquid or gaseous effluents as part of normal operations. The NRC 
summarizes U.S. nuclear power plant effluent data on its public website 
[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/contract/cr2907/index.html]. These effluents are controlled, monitored, and reported 
per NRC requirements to ensure that doses to the public are known and 
within acceptable guidelines that are as low as is reasonably 
achievable (ALARA). The Watts Bar Offsite Dose Calculation Manual 
(ODCM), documented in the Watts Bar Nuclear Power Plant 2022, Annual 
Radioactive Effluent Release Report (ADAMS Accession No. ML23117A100), 
provides the limits and methods used by TVA to ensure compliance with 
requirements that apply to radioactive effluents. Watts Bar, Units 1 
and 2, use waste treatment systems to collect, process, and recycle 
plant fluids that contain radioactive material and to dispose of 
gaseous and liquid effluents and solid wastes in a safe and controlled 
manner within NRC and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency radiation 
safety standards. Implementation of the proposed action would allow up 
to 2,496 TPBARs per cycle to be irradiated in the Watts Bar, Units 1 
and 2, reactor cores. Increasing the number of TPBARs irradiated from 
1,792 to 2,496 per reactor core could increase the quantities of 
radioactive material released from Watts Bar to the environment because 
some of the

[[Page 13759]]

tritium that is produced permeates through the TPBAR cladding and is 
released into the reactor coolant system (RCS) fluid. Radioactive 
material in RCS fluid can be released as gaseous or liquid effluent. 
For the purposes of assessing the environmental impacts and the 
regulatory compliance of this proposed action for tritium production, 
TVA assumed a core load of 2,496 TPBARs with a permeation rate of 5.0 
curies per TPBAR per year (Ci/TPBAR/year) of tritium and was able to 
demonstrate that liquid and gaseous effluents would be within 
applicable limits. The assumed permeation rate is conservative in that 
it bounds the observed and maximum TPBAR tritium permeation rates at 
Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2. Specifically, based on the licensee's 
experience with TPBARs dating back to 2004, the licensee has observed a 
permeation rate for tritium production of less than 3.5 Ci/TPBAR/year. 
Additionally, as provided in this document, the licensee demonstrated 
that other changes to the radioisotope inventory that can impact 
effluent levels would be minor and would not impact the licensee's 
ability to meet applicable limits. Therefore, while the quantity of 
tritium generated during plant operations would increase under the 
proposed action, radioactive effluents from Watts Bar would remain 
within applicable limits.

Radioactive Gaseous Effluents

    The Watts Bar units maintain a gaseous waste management system 
(GWMS) that is designed to process and control the release of 
radioactive gaseous effluents into the environment in accordance with 
the requirements of 10 CFR 20.1301, ``Dose limits for individual 
members of the public,'' and to ensure consistency with the ALARA dose 
objectives set forth in appendix I, ``Numerical Guides for Design 
Objectives and Limiting Conditions for Operation to Meet the Criterion 
`As Low as is Reasonably Achievable' for Radioactive Material in Light-
Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor Effluents,'' to 10 CFR part 50, 
``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities.''
    As stated in the license amendment request, TVA assumed a core load 
of 2,496 TPBARs with a permeation rate of 5.0 Ci/TPBAR/year of tritium, 
which is a conservative source term that bounds the observed and 
maximum TPBAR tritium permeation rate as seen from historic Watts Bar, 
Units 1 and 2, tritium production.
    To determine whether the resultant gaseous effluents would fall 
within the requirements of 10 CFR 20.1301, TVA calculated the sum of 
the ratios of each isotope concentration (C) to its corresponding 
gaseous Effluent Concentration Limit (ECL, as listed in 10 CFR part 20, 
``Standards for Protection against Radiation,'' appendix B, ``Annual 
Limits on Intake (ALIs) and Derived Air Concentrations (DACs) of 
Radionuclides for Occupational Exposure; Effluent Concentrations; 
Concentrations for Release to Sewerage,'' table 2, ``Effluent 
Concentration,'' column 1). Consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR 
20.1302(b)(2)(i), a C/ECL sum of less than 1.0 indicates that the 
annual average effluent release is within the limits of 10 CFR 20.1301. 
Tables 4.11-6 and 4.11-7 of the license amendment request demonstrate 
that TVA's calculated C/ECL sums for gaseous effluent releases at the 
Watts Bar units from an assumed core load of 2,496 TPBARs for 
containment purge without filtration would be 0.458 (single unit) and 
with continuous filtration would be 0.402 (single unit). TVA's 
calculated C/ECL sums for gaseous effluent releases for both Watts Bar, 
Units 1 and 2 (dual-unit operation) for containment purge without 
filtration would be 0.915 and with continuous filtration would be 
0.805. Therefore, the licensee demonstrated that the C/ECL ratios are 
less than 1.0 indicating that gaseous effluent releases from an assumed 
core load of 2,496 TPBARs would be within the limits of 10 CFR part 20.
    To determine whether the gaseous effluent releases would be 
consistent with the ALARA dose objectives set forth in appendix I to 10 
CFR part 50 (which are per-unit numbers), TVA calculated bounding 
public doses from the applicable plant effluent dose pathways with the 
tritium release attributable to TPBAR permeability. These doses were 
based on an assumed core load of 2,496 TPBARs and the methods and 
assumptions in the current Watts Bar ODCM. TVA calculated that the 
whole-body dose to a Maximally Exposed Individual from a single Watts 
Bar unit would be 0.60 millirem (mrem) (0.0060 millisievert (mSv)), 
which is much less than the whole-body dose objective in appendix I to 
10 CFR part 50 of 5.00 mrem (0.05 mSv). TVA also calculated that the 
organ dose (bone) to the Maximally Exposed Individual from a single 
Watts Bar unit would be 11.30 mrem (0.113 mSv), which is less than the 
organ dose objective in appendix I to 10 CFR part 50 of 15.00 mrem 
(0.15 mSv).
    Based on this information, TVA's analyses demonstrate that Watts 
Bar, Units 1 and 2, can be operated with the proposed maximum core 
loading of 2,496 TPBARs such that the current GWMS can maintain the 
gaseous effluents within the Effluent Concentration Limits listed in 10 
CFR part 20, appendix B, to meet the dose limit requirements to members 
of the public in 10 CFR 20.1301, as well as to maintain doses to the 
public ALARA as per the dose objectives set forth in appendix I to 10 
CFR part 50. Therefore, there would be no significant radiological 
effect on the quality of the human environment from gaseous effluents.

Radioactive Liquid Effluents

    The Watts Bar units' liquid radioactive waste system (LRWS) is used 
to collect and process radioactive liquid wastes to reduce 
radioactivity and chemical concentrations to levels acceptable for 
discharge to the environment. The LRWS maintains sufficient processing 
capability so that liquid waste may be discharged to the environment 
below the regulatory limits of 10 CFR 20.1301 and consistent with the 
ALARA dose objectives in appendix I to 10 CFR part 50. The Watts Bar 
units share three large storage tanks in the LRWS, which includes a 
tritiated water storage tank with a capacity of 500,000 gallons. This 
storage tank supports managing large volume/high tritium concentrations 
in the RCS for both units. These storage tanks can be used for liquid 
effluent holdup, dilution, and timing of releases to ensure that 
regulatory requirements are met. The release of radioactive liquids 
from the LRWS only occurs after laboratory analysis of the storage tank 
contents. If the activity is found to be above ODCM limits, the liquid 
waste streams are returned to the system for further processing by a 
mobile demineralizer. If the activity is found to be below the ODCM 
limits, the liquid waste stream is pumped to a discharge pipe where it 
is monitored for radiation levels and flowrate before it enters the 
cooling tower blowdown line, where it can ultimately be discharged by 
permit into the Tennessee River.
    To determine whether the liquid effluents from an assumed core load 
of 2,496 TPBARs would be within the requirements of 10 CFR 20.1301, TVA 
calculated the sum of the ratios of each isotope concentration (C) to 
its corresponding liquid Effluent Concentration Limit (ECL, as listed 
in 10 CFR part 20, appendix B, table 2, column 2). Consistent with the 
requirements of 10 CFR 20.1302(b)(2)(i), a C/ECL sum of less than 1.0 
indicates that the annual average effluent release is within the limits 
of 10 CFR 20.1301. Tables 4.11-3 through 4.11-5 of the

[[Page 13760]]

license amendment request show TVA's calculated C/ECL sums for liquid 
effluent releases from an assumed core load of 2,496 TPBARs. Table 
4.11-3 indicates that extended effluent releases, without processing 
the liquid radioactive waste streams through the mobile demineralizer 
or allowing for sufficient dilution of the radioactive waste streams, 
would not meet the regulatory requirements of 10 CFR 20.1301. The 
calculated C/ECL for a single Watts Bar unit in this scenario is 5.28, 
which is greater than the maximum allowable C/ECL of 1.0. The operation 
of both Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2 in this scenario would yield a C/ECL 
of 10.6.
    Table 4.11-4 of the license amendment request demonstrates that 
TVA's calculated C/ECL sum for liquid effluent releases for a single 
Watts Bar unit processed through the mobile demineralizer would be 
0.471. The operation of both Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2 in this scenario 
would yield a C/ECL of 0.942. Table 4.11-5 demonstrates that TVA's 
calculated C/ECL for liquid effluents not processed through the mobile 
demineralizer, but sufficiently diluted before release, for a single 
Watts Bar unit would be 0.476. The operation of both Watts Bar, Units 1 
and 2 in this scenario would yield a C/ECL of 0.952. Therefore, the 
licensee demonstrated that the C/ECL ratios are less than 1.0 
indicating that liquid effluent releases from an assumed core load of 
2,496 TPBARs would be within the limits of 10 CFR part 20.
    To determine whether the liquid effluent releases would be 
consistent with the ALARA dose objectives set forth in appendix I to 10 
CFR part 50, TVA calculated bounding public doses from the applicable 
plant effluent dose pathways with the tritium release attributable to 
TPBAR permeability. These doses were based on an assumed core load of 
2,496 TPBARs and the methods and assumptions in the current Watts Bar 
ODCM. TVA calculated that the whole-body dose to a Maximally Exposed 
Individual from liquid effluents from a single Watts Bar unit would be 
0.39 mrem (0.0039 mSv), which is much less than the whole-body dose 
objective in appendix I to 10 CFR part 50 of 3.00 mrem (0.03 mSv). TVA 
also calculated that the organ dose (liver) to the Maximally Exposed 
Individual from liquid effluents from a single Watts Bar unit would be 
0.50 mrem (0.0050 mSv), which is much less than the organ dose 
objective in appendix I to 10 CFR part 50 of 10 mrem (0.10 mSv).
    Based on this information, TVA's analyses demonstrate that by 
processing liquid radioactive waste streams through the demineralizer 
or allowing for proper dilution of the liquid radioactive waste 
streams, the current LRWS can maintain the liquid effluents within the 
Effluent Concentration Limits listed in 10 CFR part 20, appendix B, 
such that Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, can be operated with the proposed 
maximum core loading of 2,496 TPBARs. Specifically, doses from liquid 
effluents would meet the requirements regarding members of the public 
in 10 CFR 20.1301, as well as maintain the public ALARA dose objectives 
set forth in appendix I to 10 CFR part 50. Therefore, there would be no 
significant radiological effect on the quality of the human environment 
from liquid effluents.

Solid Radioactive Wastes

    Solid radioactive wastes generated by nuclear power plant 
operations at Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, are processed, packaged, and 
stored onsite until they are shipped offsite for further processing or 
permanent disposal, or both. The storage areas have restricted access 
and shielding to reduce radiation rates to plant workers. Solid 
radioactive wastes are packaged and transported in compliance with the 
NRC's regulations in 10 CFR parts 20, 61, ``Licensing Requirements for 
Land Disposal of Radioactive Waste,'' and 71, ``Packaging and 
Transportation of Radioactive Material,'' and the U.S. Department of 
Transportation's regulations in 49 CFR parts 170 through 179.
    The implementation of the proposed action of allowing an increase 
in the number of TPBARs irradiated from 1,792 to 2,496 per reactor core 
would increase the activity and volume of solid radioactive waste due 
to the irradiation of the TPBAR base plates and thimble plugs, which 
remain after TPBAR consolidation activities. As explained in a previous 
license amendment request, for the consolidation process, nuclear plant 
operators remove the irradiated TPBAR assemblies from the spent fuel 
assemblies, disassemble all the irradiated TPBARs for consolidation, 
and place them into consolidation canisters. The operators return the 
loaded consolidation canisters to the spent fuel racks, where they 
remain until removed from the site (ADAMS Accession No. ML17354B282). 
Offsite shipment and ultimate disposal would be conducted in accordance 
with agreements between TVA and the DOE. The disposal volume of the 
TPBAR base plates and thimble plugs is estimated to be 64 cubic feet 
(2.7 cubic meters) per year. This additional volume represents a slight 
increase in the Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, annual estimated solid waste 
generation from approximately 32,854 cubic feet (930 cubic meters) per 
year to 32,918 cubic feet (933 cubic meters) per year. This projected 
increase in volume can be handled by the existing equipment and plant 
procedures that control radioactive solid waste handling without 
modification. The licensee estimated the TPBAR cycle scope of work to 
evaluate the doses that are expected to workers during the TPBAR 
consolidation process. The TPBAR cycle scope, estimated at 1,200 
person-hours per cycle, includes pre-cycle preparation activities, 
post-cycle removal and handling activities, TPBAR consolidation and 
shipping activities, and the processing, packaging, and shipping of 
irradiated components. This work will occur in an estimated 0.33 mrem/
hour radiation field. Therefore, while there would be an increase in 
solid radioactive waste associated with the implementation of the 
proposed action, the existing equipment and plant procedures that 
control radioactive solid waste handling would continue to be used to 
maintain doses to members of the public and plant workers within 
applicable dose limits. Therefore, based on this information, there 
would be no significant radiological effect on the quality of the human 
environment from solid radioactive waste management.

Spent Fuel Generation, Storage, and Handling

    The number of spent fuel bundles would increase by approximately 
four to eight per cycle with the implementation of the proposed action. 
For Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, spent fuel is currently stored in spent 
fuel pools on site and in an independent spent fuel storage 
installation. There would be adequate spent fuel storage available on 
site; therefore, based on this information, there would be no 
significant radiological effect on the quality of the human environment 
from spent fuel generation, storage, and handling.

Occupational Radiation Doses

    At Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, TVA maintains a radiation protection 
program to monitor radiation levels throughout the nuclear power plant 
to establish appropriate work controls, training, temporary shielding, 
and protective equipment requirements so that worker doses remain 
within the dose limits of 10 CFR part 20, subpart C, ``Occupational 
Dose Limits.'' The implementation of the proposed action would affect 
the quantities of radioactive material generated during plant 
operations since some tritium permeates through the TPBAR cladding

[[Page 13761]]

and is released into the RCS, as previously described.
    Separate from the environmental review for this EA, the NRC is 
reviewing the technical and safety analyses provided in TVA's license 
amendment request to ensure that the licensee continues to meet NRC 
regulatory requirements for occupational dose. The results of this 
safety review will be documented in a safety evaluation that will be 
made publicly available following the issuance of the EA. If the NRC's 
safety review determines that the irradiation of 2,496 TPBARs, per 
cycle, in Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, complies with the NRC's regulations 
for occupational dose, then the proposed license amendments would not 
have a significant radiological effect on workers.

Design-Basis Accidents

    Design-basis accidents are evaluated to ensure that Watts Bar, 
Units 1 and 2, can withstand the spectrum of postulated accidents 
without undue hazard to public health and safety and ensure the 
protection of the environment.
    TVA's technical and safety analyses must meet the NRC's regulatory 
requirements for safe operation. The results of the NRC's safety review 
will be made publicly available following the issuance of the EA. If 
this safety review determines that the irradiation of 2,496 TPBARs, per 
cycle, in the Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, cores comply with the NRC's 
regulations, and there is reasonable assurance that public health and 
safety will not be endangered, then the proposed license amendments 
would not have a significant radiological effect on the quality of the 
human environment from design-basis accidents.

Radiological Impacts Summary

    Based on the radiological evaluations presented in this EA, except 
for the impacts associated with occupational radiation doses and 
design-basis accidents which are being reviewed separately, the 
implementation of the proposed action would not have a significant 
radiological effect on the quality of the human environment. If the 
NRC's safety review determines that 2,496 TPBARs, per cycle, can be 
safely irradiated in Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, and there is reasonable 
assurance that public health and safety will not be endangered, then 
implementing the proposed license amendments would not have a 
significant radiological effect on workers and the quality of the human 
environment.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC considered denial 
of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). Denial of 
the license amendment request would mean that TVA would be allowed to 
continue irradiating the current allowable number of TPBARs (i.e., 
1,792) for Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2. The environmental impacts of 
irradiating 1,792 TPBARs were previously considered and were determined 
to not have any significant radiological or non-radiological effect on 
the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the NRC concludes that 
denial of the license amendment request (i.e., the ``no-action'' 
alternative) would result in no change in current environmental effe 
cts, and would be not significant. The impacts of the ``no-action'' 
alternative would be similar to the impacts of the proposed action.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    On November 7, 2023, the NRC staff consulted with the State of 
Tennessee, regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. 
The state official had no comments on the EA and FONSI.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    TVA requests that the NRC approve amendments that would revise the 
Watts Bar, Units 1 and 2, TS 4.2.1 and TS 5.9.6 to increase the maximum 
number of TPBARs and to add supporting methodologies. The proposed 
amendments would also revise the Watts Bar Dual-Unit Updated Final 
Safety Analysis Report to modify the source term for design basis 
accident analyses to allow the core fission product inventory to be 
calculated using an updated version of the ORIGEN computer code. Based 
on the review of available information, the NRC determined that the 
proposed action would not have any significant radiological or non-
radiological environmental impacts. Also, the impacts of the ``no-
action'' alternative would be similar to the impacts of the proposed 
action. The NRC also considered the information provided in the 
licensee's application and related TVA environmental documents.
    This FONSI and related environmental documents are available for 
public inspection online in the ADAMS Public Documents collection at 
https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html. Persons who do not have 
access to ADAMS or who encounter problems in accessing the documents

Attachment--Exemption

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Docket No. 50-305

Kewaunee Solutions, Inc.

Kewaunee Power Station

Exemption

I. Background

    The Kewaunee Power Station (KPS) consists of a permanently shutdown 
and defueled pressurized water reactor located in Kewaunee County, 
Wisconsin. On May 7, 2013, the licensee at that time, Dominion Energy 
Kewaunee (DEK), permanently ceased power operations at KPS. On May 14, 
2013, DEK certified that it had permanently defueled the KPS reactor 
vessel (Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) 
Accession No. ML13135A209). On May 21, 2014 (ML13225A224), the U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved an exemption from the 
specific requirements of paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of Section 50.82 
``Termination of license,'' of Part 50, ``Domestic Licensing of 
Production and Utilization Facilities,'' of Title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) and paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of 10 CFR 50.75, 
``Reporting and recordkeeping for decommissioning planning,'' for KPS. 
This exemption authorizes the licensee to use funds from the KPS 
nuclear decommissioning trust (NDT) for the management of spent nuclear 
fuel, and allows trust disbursements for spent fuel management to be 
made without prior NRC notice.
    By letter dated March 29, 2023 (ML23093A031), Kewaunee Solutions, 
Inc., and EnergySolutions, LLC (Kewaunee Solutions and EnergySolutions, 
respectively, or the licensees), submitted, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, 
``Specific Exemptions,'' a request for an exemption to 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) that would allow KPS to use funds from the NDT for 
site restoration activities. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the licensees 
also requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv), which would 
allow trust disbursements for site restoration activities to be made 
without prior notice to the NRC, similar to withdrawals in accordance 
with 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) for decommissioning activities.
    By letter dated October 5, 2023 (ML23278A100), the licensees 
provided a response to an NRC request for additional information (RAI), 
dated August 29, 2023 (ML23222A152), pertaining to decommissioning 
trust fund (DTF) cash flows that were provided in the initial exemption 
request submittal. The funds within the DTF were collected in 
compliance with the 10 CFR 50.75 financial requirements while KPS was 
operating. The licensees included with the exemption request a cash 
flow analysis reflecting the balance of funds within the trust 
throughout the decommissioning period, based upon a DECON 
decommissioning method ending in 2055, which is the year of anticipated 
license termination.

II. Request/Action

    The request for an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) would allow the licensees 
to use funds from the KPS NDT for the management of site restoration 
activities and allow trust disbursements for site restoration 
activities to be made without prior notice to the NRC. The licensee's 
initial basis for the exemption request relied upon financial and other 
decommissioning data reflected in a May 13, 2021, letter from 
EnergySolutions titled ``Notification of Amended Post Shutdown 
Decommissioning Activities Report (Revision 2) for Kewaunee Power 
Station'' (ML21145A083), as well as on decommissioning cost estimate 
data provided with that letter. However, during the course of its 
review the NRC staff concluded that the status of funding in the KPS 
DTF had changed since submission of the May 13, 2021, letter. 
Specifically, the NRC staff noted that there were significant 
differences in the expenditure and cash flow data reported in the Post-
Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report (PSDAR) and site-specific 
decommissioning cost estimate (SSDCE) that formed the basis of the 
exemption request, and a more recent DTF Status Report, dated March 30, 
2023 (ML23089A304), for the KPS NDT, which reflects financial data 
through December 31, 2022. Therefore, the NRC staff raised a concern 
that the PSDAR and SSDCE data on which the NRC was to base its analysis 
of the portion of the exemption request relating to the requirement in 
10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A), to allow use of funds from the KPS NDT for 
site restoration activities, was outdated, and thus did not provide the 
timely information necessary for the staff to complete its analysis.
    Subsequently, the NRC staff requested additional information from 
the licensees in an RAI letter dated August 29, 2023, requesting, in 
part, ``. . . revised license termination, spent fuel management, and 
site restoration plans, including forecasted cash flow expenditure 
data, that reflect Kewaunee Solution's current assumptions about the 
decommissioning method, decommissioning activities, and the schedule of 
such activities for KPS,'' so that the staff could perform its analysis 
of the requested exemption with more timely data. The licensees 
responded by letter dated October 5, 2023, explaining that the basis 
for demonstrating adequate funding for the exemption request is 
provided in (1) the March 30, 2023, KPS DTF Status Report, which 
includes detailed license termination, spent fuel management, and site 
restoration costs; and (2) the total forecasted expenditure data 
provided in

[[Page 13383]]

the RAI response, which is based on the DECON decommissioning method 
and the current schedule for decommissioning and license termination 
activities for KPS.
    The requirement at 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) restricts withdrawals 
from an NDT to expenses for legitimate decommissioning activities 
consistent with the definition in 10 CFR 50.2, ``Definitions.'' The 
definition of ``decommission'' in 10 CFR 50.2 does not include 
activities associated with site restoration. Specifically, the 
definition of ``decommission'' in 10 CFR 50.2 is ``to remove a facility 
or site safely from service and reduce residual radioactivity to a 
level that permits (1) release of the property for unrestricted use and 
termination of the license; or (2) release of the property under 
restricted conditions and termination of the license.''
    The requirement at 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) also restricts the use of 
DTF disbursements (other than for ordinary administrative costs and 
other incidental expenses of the fund in connection with the operation 
of the fund) to decommissioning expenses until final radiological 
decommissioning is completed. While the NRC previously approved an 
exemption for KPS to use funds from the KPS NDT for the management of 
spent fuel, an additional exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 
10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) is needed to allow the licensees to use funds 
from the KPS NDT for site restoration activities at KPS. The 
requirement at 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) further provides that, except for 
withdrawals being made under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) or for payments of 
ordinary administrative costs and other incidental expenses of the fund 
in connection with the operation of the fund, no disbursement may be 
made from the DTF without written notice to the NRC at least 30 working 
days in advance. Therefore, an exemption from 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) is 
also needed to allow the licensees to use funds from the KPS NDT for 
site restoration activities at KPS without prior NRC notification.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by 
any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from 
the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 (1) when the exemptions are 
authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health 
and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; 
and (2) when any of the special circumstances listed in 10 CFR 
50.12(a)(2) are present. These special circumstances include, among 
other things:

    (ii) Application of the regulation in the particular 
circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of the rule or 
is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule; and
    (iii) Compliance would result in undue hardship or other costs 
that are significantly in excess of those contemplated when the 
regulation was adopted, or that are significantly in excess of those 
incurred by others similarly situated.

A. Authorized by Law

    The requested exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) would allow the licensees 
to use a portion of the funds from the KPS DTF for site restoration 
activities at KPS without prior notice to the NRC, in the same manner 
that withdrawals are made under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) for decommissioning 
activities and through use of a previously authorized exemption for KPS 
spent fuel management activities. As stated above, 10 CFR 50.12 allows 
the NRC to grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 
when the exemptions are authorized by law. The NRC staff has 
determined, as explained below, that granting the licensees' proposed 
exemption will not result in a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, or the Commission's regulations. Therefore, the 
exemption is authorized by law.

B. No Undue Risk to Public Health and Safety

    The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv) is to provide reasonable assurance that adequate funds 
will be available for the radiological decommissioning of power 
reactors. Based on the licensees' PSDAR, SSDCE, the most recent KPS DTF 
Status Report, additional information provided by the licensees in 
response to the NRC staff's RAI on this exemption request, and 
conclusions reached by the NRC staff in its independent cash flow 
analysis, the use of a portion of the KPS DTF for site restoration 
activities at KPS will not adversely impact the licensees' ability to 
complete radiological decommissioning within 60 years and terminate the 
KPS license. Furthermore, an exemption from 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) to 
allow KPS to make withdrawals from the DTF for site restoration 
activities without prior written notification to the NRC will not 
affect the sufficiency of funds in the DTF to accomplish radiological 
decommissioning. This is because such withdrawals are still constrained 
by the provisions of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(B)-(C) and are reviewable 
under the annual reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(v)-(vii). 
Therefore, KPS decommissioning trust funds, in accordance with 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(B)-(C), may only be used by the licensee if: (1) an 
expenditure would not reduce the value of the decommissioning trust 
below an amount necessary to place and maintain the reactor in a safe 
storage condition if unforeseen conditions or expenses arise and; (2) 
the withdrawals would not inhibit the ability of the licensees to 
complete funding of any shortfalls in the DTF needed to ensure the 
availability of funds to ultimately release the site and terminate the 
license.
    Based on the NRC staff's analysis of the information provided in 
support of this exemption request, as supplemented, there are no new 
accident precursors created by using the DTF in the proposed manner. 
Thus, the probability of postulated accidents is not increased. In 
addition, based on the above, the consequences of postulated accidents 
are not increased. No changes are being made in the types or amounts of 
effluents that may be released offsite. There is no significant 
increase in occupational or public radiation exposure. Therefore, the 
requested exemption will not present an undue risk to public health and 
safety.

C. Consistent With the Common Defense and Security

    The requested exemption would allow the licensees to use funds from 
the KPS NDT for the management of site restoration activities and allow 
trust disbursements for site restoration activities to be made without 
prior notice to the NRC. Spent fuel management under paragraph (bb) of 
10 CFR 50.54, ``Conditions of licenses,'' is an integral part of the 
planned KPS decommissioning and license termination process; the NRC 
previously approved an exemption for KPS to use funds from the KPS NDT 
for the management of spent fuel. The current change, to enable the use 
of a portion of the funds from the DTF for site restoration activities, 
and to do so without prior written NRC notification, has no relation to 
security issues. Therefore, the common defense and security is not 
impacted by the requested exemption.

D. Special Circumstances

    Special circumstances, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), 
are present whenever application of the regulation in the particular 
circumstances is not

[[Page 13384]]

necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the regulation.
    The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv), which restrict withdrawals from the DTF to expenses 
for radiological decommissioning activities, is to provide reasonable 
assurance that adequate funds will be available to complete 
radiological decommissioning of power reactors and achieve license 
termination. Strict application of these requirements would prohibit 
the withdrawal of funds from the KPS DTF for activities other than 
radiological decommissioning activities at KPS, such as for spent fuel 
management and site restoration activities, until final radiological 
decommissioning at KPS has been completed. As noted above, the NRC 
previously approved an exemption for the licensees to use funds from 
the KPS NDT for the management of spent fuel on May 21, 2014.
    According to the March 30, 2023, KPS DTF Status Report, the DTF for 
KPS contained $745.6 million as of December 31, 2022. The licensees' 
analysis projects that the total remaining radiological decommissioning 
costs at KPS will be approximately $654 million (2023 dollars), 
including the costs for decommissioning the onsite independent spent 
fuel storage installation (ISFSI). As required by 10 CFR 50.54(bb), the 
licensees estimated the costs associated with spent fuel management at 
KPS to be $36.1 million (2023 dollars). Site restoration costs are 
estimated at $38.1 million (2023 dollars). This reflects a total 
remaining estimated cost of approximately $728.2 million for 
radiological decommissioning, spent fuel management, and site 
restoration activities, with license termination anticipated in 2055. 
In its analysis, the NRC staff assumed a 2 percent annual real rate of 
return on the DTF balance as allowed by 10 CFR 50.75(e)(1)(ii), and 
determined the projected earnings of the DTF.
    The NRC staff's independent cash flow analysis projects that the 
KPS DTF will contain approximately $84.3 million following completion 
of radiological decommissioning activities at the site (year 2031), and 
$122.9 million at the end of all license termination, spent fuel 
management, and site restoration activities (year 2055), when 
considering use of the KPS DTF for payment of spent fuel management and 
site restoration expenses. The NRC staff's analysis aligns with the 
cash flow analysis provided by the licensees in their submittals. Tax 
liabilities related to DTF investments are not reflected in the NRC 
staff's analysis.
    The NRC staff confirmed that the current funds and projected 
earnings of the KPS DTF provide reasonable assurance of adequate 
funding to complete all NRC-required radiological; decommissioning 
activities at KPS, as well as to pay for spent fuel management and site 
restoration activities. Therefore, the NRC staff finds that the 
licensees have provided reasonable assurance that adequate funds will 
be available for the radiological decommissioning of KPS, even with the 
disbursement of funds from the DTF for spent fuel management and site 
restoration activities. Consequently, the NRC staff concludes that 
application of the requirements of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv), in addition to application of a previously authorized 
exemption for spent fuel management activities at KPS, which provide 
that funds from the DTF only be used for radiological decommissioning 
activities and not for site restoration activities, is not necessary to 
achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. Thus, special circumstances 
are present supporting approval of the exemption request.
    In its submittal, the licensees also requested exemption from the 
requirement of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) concerning prior written 
notification to the NRC of withdrawals from the DTF to fund activities 
other than radiological decommissioning. The underlying purpose of 
notifying the NRC prior to withdrawal of funds from the DTF is to 
provide the opportunity for NRC intervention, when deemed necessary, if 
the withdrawals are for expenses other than those authorized by 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv), 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8), and by the previously approved 
exemption for spent fuel management expenditures from the DTF, which 
could result in there being insufficient funds in the DTF to accomplish 
radiological decommissioning.
    By granting the exemption to 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) and 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A), the NRC staff considers that withdrawals consistent 
with the licensees' submittal dated March 29, 2023, are authorized. As 
stated previously, the NRC staff determined that there are sufficient 
funds in the KPS DTF to complete radiological decommissioning 
activities, as well as to conduct spent fuel management and site 
restoration activities, consistent with the licensees' PSDAR and SSDCE, 
dated May 13, 2021, as well as the information provided in support of 
its exemption request, as supplemented.
    Pursuant to the requirements in 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(v) and (vii), 
licensees are required to monitor and annually report to the NRC the 
status of the DTF and the licensee's funding for spent fuel management. 
These reports provide the NRC staff with awareness of, and the ability 
to take action on, any actual or potential funding deficiencies. 
Additionally, 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(vi) requires that the annual DTF 
Status Report must include additional financial assurance to cover the 
estimated cost of completion of radiological decommissioning if the sum 
of the balance of any remaining decommissioning funds, plus earnings on 
such funds calculated at not greater than a 2-percent real rate of 
return, together with the amount provided by other financial assurance 
methods being relied upon, does not cover the estimated cost to 
complete decommissioning.
    The requested exemption would not allow the withdrawal of funds 
from the KPS DTF for any purpose that is not currently authorized in 
the regulations, or that has previously been authorized by exemption 
from the NRC, without prior notification to the NRC. Therefore, the 
granting of the exemption to 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) to allow the 
licensees to make withdrawals from the KPS DTF to cover authorized 
expenses for site restoration activities without prior written 
notification to the NRC will still meet the underlying purpose of the 
regulation.
    Special circumstances, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(iii), 
are present whenever compliance would result in undue hardship or other 
costs that are significantly in excess of those contemplated when the 
regulation was adopted, or that are significantly in excess of those 
incurred by others similarly situated. The licensees state, and the NRC 
staff has confirmed, that the KPS DTF contains funds in excess of the 
estimated costs of radiological decommissioning. The licensees further 
state that these excess funds are needed for spent fuel management and 
site restoration activities. The NRC does not preclude the use of funds 
from the NDT in excess of those needed for radiological decommissioning 
for other purposes, such as spent fuel management or site restoration 
activities.
    The NRC has previously stated that funding for spent fuel 
management and site restoration activities may be commingled in the 
DTF, provided that the licensee is able to identify and account for the 
radiological decommissioning funds separately from the funds set aside 
for spent fuel

[[Page 13385]]

management and site restoration activities (see NRC Regulatory Issue 
Summary 2001-07, ``10 CFR 50.75 Reporting and Recordkeeping for 
Decommissioning Planning,'' Revision 1, dated January 8, 2009 
(ML083440158), and Regulatory Guide 1.184, ``Decommissioning of Nuclear 
Power Reactors,'' Revision 1, dated October 2013 (ML13144A840)). 
Preventing access to those excess funds in DTFs because spent fuel 
management and site restoration activities are not associated with 
radiological decommissioning would create an unnecessary financial 
burden without any corresponding safety benefit. The adequacy of the 
KPS DTF to cover the cost of activities associated with site 
restoration, in addition to radiological decommissioning and spent fuel 
management, is supported by the licensees' SSDCE for KPS. If the KPS 
DTF cannot be used for site restoration activities, the licensees would 
need to obtain additional funding that would not be recoverable from 
the DTF, or would have to modify the decommissioning approach and 
methods planned at KPS. The NRC staff concludes that either outcome 
would impose an unnecessary and undue burden significantly in excess of 
that contemplated when 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv) were adopted.
    The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv) would continue to be achieved by allowing the licensees 
to use a portion of the KPS DTF for site restoration activities without 
prior NRC notification, and compliance with the regulations would 
result in an undue hardship or other costs that are significantly in 
excess of those contemplated when the regulations were adopted. Thus, 
the special circumstances required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) 
exist and support the approval of the requested exemption.

E. Environmental Considerations

    In accordance with paragraph (a) of 10 CFR 51.31, ``Determinations 
based on environmental assessment,'' the Commission has determined that 
the granting of this exemption will not have a significant effect on 
the quality of the human environment, as discussed in the NRC staff's 
Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact published 
on January 25, 2024 (89 FR 4999).

IV. Conclusion

    In consideration of the above, the NRC staff finds that the 
proposed exemption confirms the adequacy of funding in the KPS DTF, 
considering growth, to complete radiological decommissioning of the 
site and to terminate the license, as well as to cover the estimated 
costs of spent fuel management and site restoration activities.
    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue 
risk to public health and safety, and is consistent with the common 
defense and security. Also, special circumstances are present. 
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Kewaunee Solutions, Inc., and 
EnergySolutions, LLC an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) to allow the use of a 
portion of the funds from the KPS DTF for site restoration activities 
in accordance with (1) the licensees' PSDAR and SSCE, (2) forecasted 
cost and scheduling information from the most recent KPS DTF Status 
Report, and (3) as provided in response to the NRC's RAI on this 
exemption request. Additionally, the Commission hereby grants the 
licensees an exemption from the requirement of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) 
to allow such withdrawals from the KPS DTF for site restoration 
activities without prior NRC notification.
    This exemption is effective upon issuance.

    Dated: January 26, 2024.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2024-0042]


Monthly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating 
Licenses and Combined Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards 
Considerations

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Monthly notice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 189.a.(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended (the Act), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) is publishing this regular monthly notice. The Act requires the 
Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to 
be issued, and grants the Commission the authority to issue and make 
immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or combined 
license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission that 
such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC), 
notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a 
hearing from any person.

DATES: Comments must be filed by March 21, 2024. A request for a 
hearing or petitions for leave to intervene must be filed by April 22, 
2024. This monthly notice includes all amendments issued, or proposed 
to be issued, from January 5, 2024, to February 1, 2024. The last 
monthly notice was published on January 23, 2024.

state that the NRC does not routinely edit comment submissions to 
remove such information before making the comment submissions available 
to the public or entering the comment into ADAMS.

II. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses and Combined Licenses and Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination

    For the facility-specific amendment requests shown in this notice, 
the Commission finds that the licensees' analyses provided, consistent 
with section 50.91 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) ``Notice for public comment; State consultation,'' are sufficient 
to support the proposed determinations that these amendment requests 
involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, 
operation of the facilities in accordance with the proposed amendments 
would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determinations.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves NSHC. In addition, the Commission may issue any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of the 30-day comment period 
if circumstances change during the 30-day comment period such that 
failure to act in a timely way would result, for example in derating or 
shutdown of the facility. If the Commission takes action on any of 
these amendments prior to the expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish in

[[Page 12874]]

the Federal Register a notice of issuance. If the Commission makes a 
final NSHC determination for any of these amendments, any hearing will 
take place after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take 
action on any amendment before 60 days have elapsed will occur very 
infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's

[[Page 12875]]

electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as Social Security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires

ADAMS Accession No................  ML23265A150.
Location in Application of NSHC...  Pages 7-9 of Attachment 1.
Brief Description of Amendment....  The proposed amendment would modify
                                     License Condition 2.C(1) and
                                     Technical Specifications (TSs)

                                     2.3(b)1, and 2.3(b)2 to remove
                                     restrictions that currently

III. Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
and Combined Licenses

    During the period since publication of the last monthly notice, the 
Commission has issued the following amendments. The Commission has 
determined for each of these amendments that the application complies 
with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The 
Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the 
Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR chapter I, which are set 
forth in the license amendment.
    A notice of consideration of issuance of amendment to facility 
operating license or combined license, as applicable, proposed NSHC 
determination, and opportunity for a hearing in connection with these 
actions, were published in the Federal Register as indicated in the 
safety evaluation for each amendment.
    Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that 
these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in 
accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), 
no environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an 
environmental assessment under the special circumstances provision in 
10 CFR 51.22(b) and has made a determination based on that assessment, 
it is so indicated in the safety evaluation for the amendment.
    For further details with respect to each action, see the amendment 
and associated documents such as the Commission's letter and safety 
evaluation, which may be obtained using the ADAMS accession numbers 
indicated in the following table. The safety evaluation will provide 
the ADAMS accession numbers for the application for amendment and the 
Federal Register citation for any environmental assessment. All of 
these items can be accessed as described in the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

Brief Description of Amendments...  The amendments revised the Fire

                                     reactor coolant pump (RCP) seal
                                     replacements. The amendments were
                                     requested in accordance with the
                                     units' operating licenses,

                                     approval. One of the criteria for
                                     such a change is that the risk
                                     increase resulting from the change
                                     is less than 1 x 10-7/year (yr) for
                                     core damage frequency and less than
                                     1 x 10-8/yr for large early release
                                     frequency. The change is to support
                                     replacement of the currently
                                     installed RCP seals with the

                                     appendix D, IX.B.3 state that ITAAC

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Material Control and Accounting of Special Nuclear Material.'' The 
NRC hereby informs potential respondents that an agency may not conduct 
or sponsor, and that a person is not required to respond to, a 
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on October 2, 2023, 88 FR 67827.
    1. The title of the information collection: 10 CFR part 74, 
Material Control and Accounting of Special Nuclear Material.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0123.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Submission of 
fundamental nuclear material control plans is a one-time requirement 
which has been completed by all current licensees as required. However, 
licensees may submit amendments or revisions to the plans as necessary. 
Reports are submitted as events occur.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Persons licensed under 
part 74 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), who 
possess and use certain forms and quantities of special nuclear 
material (SNM).
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 183.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 163.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 9,439 hours (939

[Docket Nos. 50-269, 50-270, and 50-287; NRC-2021-0146]


Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC; Oconee Nuclear Station, Units 1, 2, 
and 3; Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Request for comment; public comment meetings; opportunity to 
request a hearing and to petition for leave to intervene.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing for 
public comment draft Site-Specific Supplement 2, Second Renewal, to the 
Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) for License Renewal of 
Nuclear Plants, NUREG-1437, regarding the proposed subsequent renewal 
of Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-38, DPR-47, and DPR-55, 
for an additional 20 years of operation for Oconee Nuclear Station, 
Units 1, 2, and 3 (Oconee Station). Oconee Station is located in 
Seneca, South Carolina, approximately 30 miles west of Greenville. 
Possible alternatives to the proposed action of subsequent license 
renewal (SLR) include no action and reasonable replacement power 
alternatives. A new notice of opportunity to request a hearing and 
petition for leave to intervene is also being issued.

DATES: The staff will hold two public meetings, one in-person near 
Oconee Station and one through online webinar and teleconference call, 
on the draft site-specific environmental impact statement (EIS), 
including a presentation on the preliminary findings and a transcribed 
public comment session. The in-person meeting will be held on February 
21, 2024, at 7 p.m. eastern time (ET) at the Madren Conference Center 
on the grounds of Clemson University. The virtual meeting will be held 
February 27, 2024, at 1 p.m. ET. The public meeting details can be 
found on the NRC's Public Meeting Schedule at https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg. Members of the public are invited to submit comments within 45 
days of an upcoming Federal Register notice anticipated to be published 
on February 16, 2024, by the Environmental Protection Agency. Comments 
received after that date will be considered if it is practical to do 
so, but the NRC is able to ensure consideration only for comments 
received on or before that date. Requests for a hearing or petitions 
for leave to intervene must be filed by April 15, 2024.

II. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing for public comment draft Site-Specific 
Supplement 2, Second Renewal, to the GEIS for License Renewal of 
Nuclear Plants, NUREG-1437, regarding the proposed subsequent renewal 
of

[[Page 10108]]

Renewed Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-38, DPR-47, and DPR-55, for 
an additional 20 years of operation for Oconee Station. Draft site-
specific Supplement 2, Second Renewal, to the GEIS includes the 
preliminary analysis that evaluates the environmental impacts of the 
proposed action and alternatives to the proposed action. It considers 
the impacts of all subsequent license renewal issues applicable to 
Oconee Station subsequent license renewal on a site-specific basis. The 
NRC staff prepared the draft site-specific Supplement 2, Second 
Renewal, to the GEIS for Oconee Station in accordance with the 
Commission's decisions in Commission Legal Issuance (CLI)-22-03 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML22055A527), that references CLI-22-02 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML22055A496), both dated February 24, 2022. Based on the NRC 
staff's (i) review of the SLR application, which includes the 
environmental report, supplemental documents, and the licensee's 
responses to the NRC staff's requests for additional information; (ii) 
consultation with Federal, State, Tribal, and local governmental 
agencies and consideration of input from other stakeholders; and (iii) 
independent environmental review as documented in the draft site-
specific EIS, the NRC staff's preliminary recommendation is that the 
adverse environmental impacts of subsequent license renewal for Oconee 
Station are not so great that preserving the option of subsequent 
license renewal for energy-planning decisionmakers would be 
unreasonable.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    As the Commission directed in CLI-22-03, a new notice of 
opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave to intervene is 
being issued.
    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
persons (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner

[[Page 10109]]

are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    Detailed information about the subsequent license renewal process 
can be found on the NRC's public website, under Reactor License 
Renewal, at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal.html. Materials involving the request to renew the operating 
licenses for Oconee Station are available for public inspection at the 
NRC's PDR, and at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/subsequent-license-renewal.html.

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, 
``Comprehensive Decommissioning Program, Annual Site List and Point of 
Contact.'' The NRC hereby informs potential respondents that an agency 
may not conduct or sponsor, and that a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on November 21, 2023, 88 FR 
81111.
    1. The title of the information collection: Comprehensive 
Decommissioning Program, Annual Site List and Point of Contact.
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0206.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Annually.

[[Page 9874]]

    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: All Agreement States 
who have signed Section 274(b) Agreements with the NRC.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 39.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 39.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 49.5 hours.
    10. Abstract: Agreement States will be asked to provide a list of 
sites undergoing decommissioning, and a point of contact for 
information about uranium recovery and complex sites undergoing 
decommissioning that are regulated by the Agreement States. The 
information request will allow the NRC to compile, in a centralized 
location, a list of sites and points of contact who can provide 
information regarding Agreement State sites undergoing decommissioning 
in the United States. This does not apply to information, such as trade 
secrets and commercial or financial information provided by the 
Agreement States, that is considered privileged or confidential.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 70-0152; NRC-2024-0021]


Purdue University; License Renewal Application

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Acceptance for docketing; opportunity to request a hearing and 
to petition for leave to intervene; order imposing procedures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received an 
application from Purdue University (Purdue or the applicant), to renew 
Special Nuclear Material (SNM) License Number 142 (SNM-142). The 
renewed license would authorize the applicant to continue to use SNM in 
various research operations, calibration, and testing at its campus in 
West Lafayette, Indiana. If the license renewal application is 
approved, the license would authorize Purdue to continue to possess and 
use SNM under NRC regulations for 10 years beyond its current license. 
Because the license application contains sensitive unclassified non-
safeguards information (SUNSI) and safeguards information (SGI), an 
order imposes procedures to obtain access to SUNSI and SGI for 
contention preparation.

DATES: A request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene must 
be filed by April 9, 2024. Any potential party as defined in section 
2.4 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) who 
believes access to SUNSI or SGI is necessary to respond to this notice 
must request document access by February 20, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC received, by letter dated September 18, 2023 (ADAMS Package 
Accession No. ML23268A087), an application from Purdue to renew its 
license, SNM-142. Purdue is authorized to use SNM under 10 CFR part 70, 
``Domestic Licensing of Special Nuclear Material,'' at its campus in 
West Lafayette for research operations, calibration, and testing. More 
specifically, Purdue may possess and use SNM for, among other things, 
activities associated with the study of thermal and mechanical 
properties of uranium dioxide (UO2); activation analysis 
studies, instrument calibration, and other research projects as 
approved by the university's radiation safety committee using 
plutonium-beryllium (PuBe) sources; and activities associated with the 
Fast Breeder Blanket Facility.
    The renewed SNM license would allow Purdue to continue licensed 
activities for 10 years. Purdue filed the original license renewal 
application on July 21, 2023, at least 30 days before the license's 
expiration date of September 25, 2023. This original application 
included incorrect security markings, leading Purdue to re-submit the 
application (including all of the enclosures) with the correct security 
markings by letter dated September 18, 2023. The NRC staff docketed the 
resubmitted application. Under 10 CFR 70.38(a), when a licensee files 
an application for renewal not less than 30 days before the expiration 
date of the existing license, the license will not expire until the 
Commission makes a final determination regarding the license renewal 
application. Although the original renewal request was incorrectly 
marked, Purdue submitted it at least 30 days before the expiration 
date. Therefore, pursuant to the timely renewal provisions in 10 CFR 
70.38(a), Purdue is permitted to continue using its SNM in accordance 
with the existing SNM-142 license, pending final decision by the 
Commission on the license renewal application.
    An NRC acceptance review of the revised application, dated December 
13, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23324A448), found the application 
acceptable for a technical review. In its letter accepting the 
application for a technical review, the NRC included three observations 
related to information the NRC could potentially request during the 
technical review. These observations where that: (1) the application 
was not updated to include financial awareness of the Nuclear Energy 
Innovation and Modernization Act and the requirements therein; (2) the 
material control and accounting portions of the application included 
outdated regulatory citations; and (3) the radioactive waste management 
program at Purdue is tied to the NRC's broadscope license under 10 CFR 
part 33 and thus, the application should highlight what commitments are 
needed for the renewal of the part 70 SNM license. During the technical 
review, the NRC will evaluate the application for radiation safety, 
nuclear criticality safety, chemical safety, fire safety, security, 
decommissioning, decommissioning financial assurance, and material 
control/accountability. The NRC will document its findings in a safety 
evaluation report.

II. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the renewal of the special nuclear materials 
license. Petitions shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's 
``Agency Rules of Practice and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested 
persons should consult 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed within 60 
days, the presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if 
appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h), no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://;adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the RC website at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

III. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the

[[Page 9184]]

internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as 
discussed below, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic 
submissions is located in the Guidance for Electronic Submissions to 
the NRC (ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system timestamps the document and sends the 
submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as described above, click ``cancel'' when the link requests 
certificates and you will be automatically directed to the NRC's 
electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information and Safeguards Information for Contention 
Preparation

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing sensitive 
unclassified information (including Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information (SUNSI) and Safeguards Information (SGI)). 
Requirements for access to SGI are primarily set forth in 10 CFR parts 
2 and 73. Nothing in this Order is intended to conflict with the SGI 
regulations.
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of hearing or 
opportunity for hearing, any potential party who believes access to 
SUNSI or SGI is necessary to respond to this notice may request access 
to SUNSI or SGI. A ``potential party'' is any person who intends to 
participate as a party by demonstrating standing and filing an 
admissible contention under 10 CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI 
or SGI submitted later than 10 days after publication will not be 
considered absent a showing of good cause for the late filing, 
addressing why the request could not have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI, SGI, or both to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: 
Rulemakings and Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy 
General Counsel for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the 
General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 
20555-0001. The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both 
offices is: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, 
Rockville, Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the 
Secretary and the Office of the General Counsel are 
[email protected] and [email protected], 
respectively.\1\ The request must include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI and/or SGI 
under these procedures should be submitted as described in this 
paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice;
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1);

[[Page 9185]]

    (3) If the request is for SUNSI, the identity of the individual or 
entity requesting access to SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the 
need for the information in order to meaningfully participate in this 
adjudicatory proceeding. In particular, the request must explain why 
publicly available versions of the information requested would not be 
sufficient to provide the basis and specificity for a proffered 
contention; and
    (4) If the request is for SGI, the identity of each individual who 
would have access to SGI if the request is granted, including the 
identity of any expert, consultant, or assistant who will aid the 
requestor in evaluating the SGI. In addition, the request must contain 
the following information:
    (a) A statement that explains each individual's ``need to know'' 
the SGI, as required by 10 CFR 73.2 and 10 CFR 73.22(b)(1). Consistent 
with the definition of ``need to know'' as stated in 10 CFR 73.2, the 
statement must explain:
    (i) Specifically, why the requestor believes that the information 
is necessary to enable the requestor to proffer and/or adjudicate a 
specific contention in this proceeding; \2\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Broad SGI requests under these procedures are unlikely to 
meet the standard for need to know; furthermore, NRC staff redaction 
of information from requested documents before their release may be 
appropriate to comport with this requirement. These procedures do 
not authorize unrestricted disclosure or less scrutiny of a 
requestor's need to know than ordinarily would be applied in 
connection with an already-admitted contention or non-adjudicatory 
access to SGI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The technical competence (demonstrable knowledge, skill, 
training or education) of the requestor to effectively utilize the 
requested SGI to provide the basis and specificity for a proffered 
contention. The technical competence of a potential party or its 
counsel may be shown by reliance on a qualified expert, consultant, or 
assistant who satisfies these criteria.
    (b) A completed Form SF-85, ``Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive 
Positions,'' for each individual who would have access to SGI. The 
completed Form SF-85 will be used by the Office of Administration to 
conduct the background check required for access to SGI, as required by 
10 CFR part 2, subpart C, and 10 CFR 73.22(b)(2), to determine the 
requestor's trustworthiness and reliability. For security reasons, Form 
SF-85 can only be submitted electronically through the National 
Background Investigation Services e-App system, a secure website that 
is owned and operated by the Defense Counterintelligence and Security 
Agency (DCSA). To obtain online access to the form, the requestor 
should contact the NRC's Office of Administration at 301-415-3710.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ The requestor will be asked to provide the requestor's full 
name, social security number, date and place of birth, telephone 
number, and email address. After providing this information, the 
requestor usually should be able to obtain access to the online form 
within one business day.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) A completed Form FD-258 (fingerprint card), signed in original 
ink, and submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 73.57(d). Copies of Form 
FD-258 will be provided in the background check request package 
supplied by the Office of Administration for each individual for whom a 
background check is being requested. The fingerprint card will be used 
to satisfy the requirements of 10 CFR part 2, subpart C, 10 CFR 
73.22(b)(1), and Section 149 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended, which mandates that all persons with access to SGI must be 
fingerprinted for an FBI identification and criminal history records 
check.
    (d) A check or money order payable in the amount of $310.00 \4\ to 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for each individual for whom the 
request for access has been submitted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ This fee is subject to change pursuant to DCSA's adjustable 
billing rates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) If the requestor or any individual(s) who will have access to 
SGI believes they belong to one or more of the categories of 
individuals that are exempt from the criminal history records check and 
background check requirements in 10 CFR 73.59, the requestor should 
also provide a statement identifying which exemption the requestor is 
invoking and explaining the requestor's basis for believing that the 
exemption applies. While processing the request, the Office of 
Administration, Personnel Security Branch, will make a final 
determination whether the claimed exemption applies. Alternatively, the 
requestor may contact the Office of Administration for an evaluation of 
their exemption status prior to submitting their request. Persons who 
are exempt from the background check are not required to complete the 
SF-85 or Form FD-258; however, all other requirements for access to 
SGI, including the need to know, are still applicable.

    Note:  Copies of documents and materials required by paragraphs 
C.(4)(b), (c), and (d) of this Order must be sent to the following 
address:

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Administration, ATTN: 
Personnel Security Branch, Mail Stop: TWFN-07D04M, 11555 Rockville 
Pike, Rockville, MD 20852

    These documents and materials should not be included with the 
request letter to the Office of the Secretary, but the request letter 
should state that the forms and fees have been submitted as required.
    D. To avoid delays in processing requests for access to SGI, the 
requestor should review all submitted materials for completeness and 
accuracy (including legibility) before submitting them to the NRC. The 
NRC will return incomplete packages to the sender without processing.
    E. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraphs C.(3) or C.(4), as applicable, the NRC staff will determine 
within 10 days of receipt of the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI or need to know the SGI requested.
    F. For requests for access to SUNSI, if the NRC staff determines 
that the requestor satisfies both E.(1) and E.(2), the NRC staff will 
notify the requestor in writing that access to SUNSI has been granted. 
The written notification will contain instructions on how the requestor 
may obtain copies of the requested documents, and any other conditions 
that may apply to access to those documents. These conditions may 
include, but are not limited to, the signing of a Non-Disclosure 
Agreement or Affidavit, or Protective Order setting forth terms and 
conditions to prevent the unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of 
SUNSI by each individual who will be granted access to SUNSI.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    G. For requests for access to SGI, if the NRC staff determines that 
the requestor has satisfied both E.(1) and E.(2), the Office of 
Administration will then determine, based upon completion of the 
background check, whether the proposed recipient is trustworthy and 
reliable, as required for access to SGI by 10 CFR 73.22(b). If the 
Office of Administration determines that the individual or individuals 
are trustworthy and reliable, the NRC will promptly notify the 
requestor in writing. The notification will provide the names of 
approved individuals as well as the conditions under which the SGI will 
be provided. Those conditions may include, but are not limited to, the 
signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement

[[Page 9186]]

or Affidavit, or Protective Order \6\ by each individual who will be 
granted access to SGI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non- Disclosure 
Agreement or Affidavit for SGI must be filed with the presiding 
officer or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 180 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    H. Release and Storage of SGI. Prior to providing SGI to the 
requestor, the NRC staff will conduct (as necessary) an inspection to 
confirm that the recipient's information protection system is 
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of 10 CFR 73.22. Alternatively, 
recipients may opt to view SGI at an approved SGI storage location 
rather than establish their own SGI protection program to meet SGI 
protection requirements.
    I. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI or SGI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 days 
after receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more than 
25 days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) the 
information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing), the 
petitioner may file its SUNSI or SGI contentions by that later 
deadline.
    J. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI or SGI is denied by the NRC 
staff either after a determination on standing and requisite need, or 
after a determination on trustworthiness and reliability, the NRC staff 
shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly stating the 
reason or reasons for the denial.
    (2) Before the Office of Administration makes a final adverse 
determination regarding the trustworthiness and reliability of the 
proposed recipient(s) for access to SGI, the Office of Administration, 
in accordance with 10 CFR 2.336(f)(1)(iii), must provide the proposed 
recipient(s) any records that were considered in the trustworthiness 
and reliability determination, including those required to be provided 
under 10 CFR 73.57(e)(1), so that the proposed recipient(s) have an 
opportunity to correct or explain the record.
    (3) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination with respect to access to SUNSI or with respect to 
standing or need to know for SGI by filing a challenge within 5 days of 
receipt of that determination with: (a) the presiding officer 
designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been 
appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if this individual is 
unavailable, another administrative judge, or an Administrative Law 
Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another 
officer has been designated to rule on information access issues, with 
that officer.
    (4) The requestor may challenge the Office of Administration's 
final adverse determination with respect to trustworthiness and 
reliability for access to SGI by filing a request for review in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.336(f)(1)(iv).
    (5) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    K. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest independent of the proceeding. 
Such a challenge must be filed within 5 days of the notification by the 
NRC staff of its grant of access and must be filed with: (a) the 
presiding officer designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another administrative judge, or an 
Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); 
or (c) if another officer has been designated to rule on information 
access issues, with that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or denying access) is governed by 10 
CFR 2.311.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562; August 3, 2012, 78 FR 34247, June 7, 2013) apply to 
appeals of NRC staff determinations (because they must be served on 
a presiding officer or the Commission, as applicable), but not to 
the initial SUNSI/SGI request submitted to the NRC staff under these 
procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    L. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests 
for access to SUNSI or SGI, and motions for protective orders, in a 
timely fashion in order to minimize any unnecessary delays in 
identifying those petitioners who have standing and who have propounded 
contentions meeting the specificity and basis requirements in 10 CFR 
part 2. The attachment to this Order summarizes the general target 
schedule for processing and resolving requests under these procedures.
    It is so ordered.

    Dated: February 5, 2024.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Carrie M. Safford,
Secretary of the Commission.

20....................  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff
                         informs the requestor of the staff's
                         determination whether the request for access
                         provides a reasonable basis to believe standing
                         can be established and shows (1) need for SUNSI
                         or (2) need to know for SGI. (For SUNSI, NRC
                         staff also informs any party to the proceeding
                         whose interest independent of the proceeding
                         would be harmed by the release of the
                         information.) If NRC staff makes the finding of
                         need for SUNSI and likelihood of standing, NRC
                         staff begins document processing (preparation
                         of redactions or review of redacted documents).
                         If NRC staff makes the finding of need to know
                         for SGI and likelihood of standing, NRC staff
                         begins background check (including
                         fingerprinting for a criminal history records
                         check), information processing (preparation of
                         redactions or review of redacted documents),
                         and readiness inspections.
25....................  If NRC staff finds no ``need,'' no ``need to
                         know,'' or no likelihood of standing, the
                         deadline for requestor/petitioner to file a
                         motion seeking a ruling to reverse the NRC
                         staff's denial of access; NRC staff files copy
                         of access determination with the presiding
                         officer (or Chief Administrative Judge or other
                         designated officer, as appropriate). If NRC
                         staff finds ``need'' for SUNSI, the deadline
                         for any party to the proceeding whose interest
                         independent of the proceeding would be harmed
                         by the release of the information to file a
                         motion seeking a ruling to reverse the NRC
                         staff's grant of access.
30....................  Deadline for NRC staff reply to motions to
                         reverse NRC staff determination(s).

Introduction

    The Agenda is a compilation of all rulemaking activities on which 
an agency has recently completed action or has proposed or is 
considering action. The Agenda reports rulemaking activities in three 
major categories: completed, active, and long-term. Completed 
rulemaking activities are those that were completed since publication 
of an agency's last Agenda; active rulemaking activities are those for 
which an agency currently plans to have an Advance Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking, a Proposed Rule, or a Final Rule issued within the next 12 
months; and long-term rulemaking activities are rulemaking activities 
under development but for which an agency does not expect to have a 
regulatory action within the 12 months after publication of the current 
edition of the Unified Agenda.
    The NRC assigns a ``Regulation Identifier Number'' (RIN) to a 
rulemaking activity when the Commission initiates a rulemaking and 
approves a rulemaking plan, or when the NRC staff begins work on a 
Commission-delegated rulemaking that does not require a rulemaking 
plan. The Office of Management and Budget uses this number to track all 
relevant documents throughout the entire ``lifecycle'' of a particular 
rulemaking activity. The NRC reports all rulemaking activities in the 
Agenda that have been assigned a RIN and meet the definition for a 
completed, an active, or a long-term rulemaking activity.
    The information contained in this Agenda is updated to reflect 
agency priorities, planning and coordination of public engagement 
efforts, and regulatory actions that have occurred on a rulemaking 
activity since publication of our last Agenda on July 27, 2023. 
Specifically, the information in this Agenda has been updated through 
August 17, 2023. The NRC provides additional information on planned 
rulemaking and petition for rulemaking activities, including priority 
and schedule, in the NRC's Rulemaking Tracking System on our website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/rulemaking-ruleforum/active/ruleindex.html.
    The date for the next scheduled action under the heading 
``Timetable'' is the date the next regulatory action for the rulemaking 
activity is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register. The date 
is considered tentative and is not binding on the Commission or its 
staff. The Agenda is intended to provide the public early notice and 
opportunity to participate in our rulemaking process. However, we may 
consider or act on any rulemaking activity even though it is not 
included in the Agenda.

Section 610 Periodic Reviews Under The Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires 
agencies to conduct a review within 10 years of issuance of those 
regulations that have or will have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. We undertake these reviews to 
decide whether the rules should be unchanged, amended, or withdrawn. We 
have initiated one review that has a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. Please see docket NRC-2023-0062 
at https://www.regulations.gov to comment on NRC's newly initiated 
review, ``Section 610 Review of Physical Protection of Byproduct 
Material''. A complete listing of our regulations that impact small 
entities and related Small Entity Compliance Guides are available from 
the NRC's website at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (NRC)

Prerule Stage

604. Physical Protection of Byproduct Material [NRC-2023-0062] (Section 
610 Review) [3150-AK94]

    Legal Authority: 42 U.S.C. 2201; 42 U.S.C. 5841
    Abstract: On March 19, 2013, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC) promulgated Physical Protection of Byproduct Material (78 FR 
16922). The rule amended NRC's regulations to establish security 
requirements for the use and transport of category 1 and category 2 
quantities of radioactive material. Subsequently, on September 30, 
2014, the NRC promulgated Safeguards Information--Modified Handling 
Categorization; Change for Materials Facilities (79 FR 58664), to 
protect security-related information for large irradiators, 
manufacturers and distributors, and for the transport of category 1 
quantities of radioactive material using the information protection 
requirements in Part 37. This new entry in the regulatory agenda 
announces that NRC plans to conduct a review of this action pursuant to 
section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 610) to 
determine if the provisions that could affect small entities should be 
continued without change or should be rescinded or amended to minimize 
adverse economic impacts on small entities. As part of this review, NRC 
will consider the following factors: (1) The continued need for the 
rule; (2) the nature of complaints or comments received concerning the 
rule; (3) the complexity of the rule; (4) the extent to which the rule 
overlaps, duplicates, or conflicts with other Federal, State, or local 
government rules; and (5) the degree to which the technology, economic 
conditions or other factors have changed in the area affected by the 
rule. As part of this review, the NRC will solicit public comments

0033] [3150-AJ36]

    Legal Authority: 42 U.S.C. 2201; 42 U.S.C. 5841
    Abstract: This rulemaking would amend the NRC's acquisition 
regulation that governs the procurement of goods and services for the 
agency. The purpose of this rulemaking is to update the NRC's 
acquisitions regulations (NRCAR) to conform with external regulations, 
incorporate NRC organizational changes, and remove outdated or obsolete 
information. The revisions would affect both internal and

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing a revision in the NRC's ``Regulatory Guide'' 
series. This series was developed to describe methods that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the 
agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff uses in 
evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to describe 
information that the staff needs in its review of applications for 
permits and licenses.
    The proposed Revision 1 to RG 1.204 was issued with a temporary 
identification of draft Regulatory Guide, DG-1409. Revision 0 of RG 
1.204 was issued in November 2005 to endorse IEEE Std. 665-1995; IEEE 
Std. 666-1991; IEEE Std. 1050-1996; and IEEE Std. C62.23-1995. The IEEE 
standards 1050, 666 and C62.23 were revised in 2004, 2007 and 2017, 
respectively. This revision updates the RG and endorses IEEE Std. 665-
1995, IEEE Std. 1050-2004; IEEE Std. 666-2007; and IEEE Std. C62.23-
2017, with certain clarifications. This revision also addresses one 
National Fire Protection Association standard and one Underwriters 
Laboratory standard as useful secondary references for demonstrating 
compliance with the applicable NRC regulations for adequate lightning 
protection of safety-related systems, structures, and components.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC published a notice of the availability of DG-1409 in the 
Federal Register on May 3, 2023 (88 FR 27714) for a 30-day public 
comment period. The public comment period closed on June 2, 2023. 
Public comments on DG-1409 and the staff responses to the public 
comments are available under ADAMS under Accession No. ML23241A965.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under 1 CFR 
chapter I.

III. Congressional Review Act

    This RG is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    The NRC staff may use this RG as a reference in its regulatory 
processes, such as licensing, inspection, or enforcement. However, the 
NRC staff does not intend to use the guidance in this RG to support NRC 
staff actions in a manner that would constitute backfitting as that 
term is defined in section 50.109 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR), ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC 
Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward 
Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information Requests,'' nor does the NRC 
staff

[[Page 8330]]

intend to use the guidance to affect the issue finality of an approval 
under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for 
Nuclear Power Plants.'' The staff also does not intend to use the 
guidance to support NRC staff actions in a manner that constitutes 
forward fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 8.4. If a 
licensee believes that the NRC is using this RG in a manner 
inconsistent with the discussion in the Implementation section of the 
RG, then the licensee may file a backfitting or forward fitting appeal 
with the NRC in accordance with the process in MD 8.4.

V. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    As part of its review of non-light-water reactor applications, the 
NRC determines whether materials proposed to be used will allow 
components to fulfill design requirements for the design life, or that 
adequate surveillance and monitoring programs are in place. The NRC 
regulations in part 50 and part 52 of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) include requirements for material qualification 
and performance monitoring. The NRC endorsed American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code Section III, Division 5, ``High 
Temperature Reactors'' (Section III-5), with conditions, in Revision 2 
of Regulatory Guide 1.87, ``Acceptability of ASME Code, Section III, 
Division 5, `High Temperature Reactors,' '' (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML22101A263).

II. Discussion

    The purpose of this ISG, ``Material Compatibility for Non-Light 
Water Reactors, DANU-ISG-2023-01'' (ADAMS Accession No. ML23188A178), 
is to aid the NRC staff reviewing non-light-water reactor applications 
for a construction permit or operating license under 10 CFR part 50 or 
for a design certification, combined license,

[[Page 8066]]

standard design approval, or manufacturing license under 10 CFR part 52 
that propose to use materials allowed under Section III-5. Section III-
5 specifies the mechanical properties and allowable stresses to be used 
for design of components in high temperature reactors. Because Section 
III-5 states that it does not provide methods to evaluate deterioration 
that may occur in service as a result of corrosion, mass transfer 
phenomena, radiation effects, or other material instabilities, this ISG 
identifies information that the NRC staff should consider as part of 
its review of a non-light-water reactor application to review 
applicable design requirements, including qualification and monitoring 
programs for safety-significant structures, systems, and components.

III. Additional Information

    Draft DANU-ISG-2023-01 ``Material Compatibility for Non-Light Water 
Reactors'' was published in the Federal Register for public comment on 
March 7, 2023, (88 FR 14186) with a 60-day comment period. The NRC 
received fifteen public comments from private citizens and industry 
organizations. The NRC staff's evaluation and resolution of the public 
comments are documented in Appendix A to the ISG in ADAMS under 
Accession No. ML23188A178.

IV. Congressional Review Act

    DANU-ISG-2023-01 ``Material Compatibility for Non-Light Water 
Reactors'' is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

[NRC-2024-0032]


Regulatory Guide: Basis for Withdrawal of Regulatory Guides in 
Division 6, ``Products,'' and Division 10, ``General''

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Regulatory guide; withdrawal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC is withdrawing RGs in Division 6, ``Products,'' (RGs 6.1, 
6.2, 6.4, 6.5, and 6.9), and in Division 10, ``General,'' (RGs 10.2, 
10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, and 10.9). The titles of these RGs 
are as follows:

    (1) RG 6.1, Leak Testing Radioactive Brachytherapy Sources;
    (2) RG 6.2, Integrity and Test Specifications for Selected 
Brachytherapy Sources;
    (3) RG 6.4, Verification of Containment Properties of Sealed 
Radioactive Sources;
    (4) RG 6.5, General Safety Standard for Installations Using 
Nonmedical Sealed Gamma-Ray Sources;
    (5) RG 6.9, Establishing Quality Assurance Programs for the 
Manufacture and Distribution of Sealed Sources and Devices 
Containing Byproduct Material;
    (6) RG 10.2, Guidance to Academic Institutions Applying for 
Specific Byproduct Material Licenses of Limited Scope;
    (7) RG 10.3, Guide for the Preparation of Applications for 
Special Nuclear Material Licenses for Less than Critical Mass 
Quantities;
    (8) RG 10.4, Guide for the Preparation of Applications for 
Licenses to Process Source Material;
    (9) RG 10.5, Applications for a Type A License of Broad Scope;
    (10) RG 10.6, Guide for the Preparation of Applications for an 
Industrial Radiography License;
    (11) RG 10.7, Guide for the Preparation of Applications for 
Licenses for Laboratory and Industrial Use of Small Quantities of 
Byproduct Material;
    (12) RG 10.8, Guide for the Preparation of Applications for 
Medical Use Programs; and
    (13) RG 10.9, Guide for the Preparation of Applications for 
Licenses for the Use of Self-Contained Dry Source-Storage Gamma 
Irradiators.

    The NRC staff issued these RGs in the 1970s and 1980s to comply 
with the regulations in title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR), 10 CFR part 30, ``Rules of General Applicability to Domestic 
Licensing of Byproduct Material,'' 10 CFR part 33, ``Specific Domestic 
Licenses of Broad Scope for Byproduct Material,'' 10 CFR part 32, 
``Specific Domestic Licenses to Manufacture or Transfer Certain Items 
Containing Byproduct Material,'' 10 CFR part 34, ``Licenses for 
Industrial Radiography and Radiation Safety Requirements for Industrial 
Radiographic Operations,'' 10 CFR part 35, ``Medical Use of Byproduct 
Material,'' 10 CFR part 70 ``Domestic Licensing of Special Nuclear 
Material,'' 10 CFR part 150 ``Exemptions and Continued Regulatory 
Authority in Agreement States and in Offshore Waters under Section 
274,'' 10 CFR part 20, ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,'' 
10 CFR part 71, ``Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive 
Material,'' and 10 CFR part 75, ``Safeguards on Nuclear Material--
Implementation of Safeguards Agreements Between the United States and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency.''
    Since the staff has consolidated and follows the latest guidance 
pertinent to materials licensees found in the NUREG-1556 Series, 
``Consolidated Guidance About Materials Licenses,'' these RGs became 
outdated. Because NUREG-1556 provides up-to-date guidance to NRC 
byproduct material licensees, the staff determined that these RGs 
needed to be withdrawn. The basis for the withdrawal is available under 
ADAMS Accession No. ML23333A446.
    Because these RGs are no longer needed, the NRC is withdrawing 
them. Withdrawal of an RG means that the guide no longer provides 
useful information or has been superseded by other guidance, 
technological innovations, congressional actions, or other events. The 
withdrawal of these RGs does not alter any prior or existing

[[Page 6008]]

NRC licensing approval or the acceptability of licensee commitments to 
these RGs. Although these RGs are withdrawn, current licensees may 
continue to use them, and withdrawal does not affect any existing 
licenses or agreements. However, these RGs should not be used in future 
requests or applications for NRC licensing actions.

II. Additional Information

    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under 1 CFR 
chapter I.

III. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    During the period from December 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, the 
NRC granted three exemptions in response to requests submitted by the 
licensee, Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Constellation), from 
October 13, 2023, to December 7, 2023. Constellation's requested 
exemptions pertaining to its Byron Station, Units 1 and 2; R.E. Ginna 
Nuclear Power Plant; and Braidwood Station, Units 1 and 2. These 
exemptions temporarily allow the licensee to deviate from certain 
requirements of part 73 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(10 CFR), ``Physical Protection of Plants and Materials,'' subpart T, 
``Security Notifications, Reports, and Recordkeeping.'' In support of 
its exemption requests, Constellation agreed to effect site-specific 
administrative controls that maintain the approach to complying with 10 
CFR part 73 in effect prior to the NRC's issuance of a final rule, 
``Enhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and Security Event 
Notifications,'' which was published in the Federal Register on March 
14, 2023, and became effective on April 13, 2023 (88 FR 15864).

II. Availability of Documents

    The tables in this notice provide transparency regarding the number 
and type of exemptions the NRC has issued and provide the facility 
name, docket number, document description, document date, and ADAMS 
accession number for each exemption issued. Additional details on each 
exemption issued, including the exemption request submitted by the 
respective licensee and the NRC's decision, are provided in each 
exemption approval listed in the following tables. For additional 
directions on accessing information in ADAMS, see the ADDRESSES section

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing a revision in the NRC's ``Regulatory Guide'' 
series. This series was developed to describe methods that are 
acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the 
agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff uses in 
evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to describe 
information that the staff needs in its review of applications for 
permits and licenses.
    The proposed Revision 2 to RG 1.73 was issued with a temporary 
identification of Draft Regulatory Guide, (DG)-1386 (ADAMS Accession 
No. ML23055B024). This revision endorses, with exceptions, additions, 
and clarifications, the methods described in the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard (Std.) 382-2019, 
``IEEE Standard for Qualification of Safety-Related Actuators for 
Nuclear Power Generating Stations and Other Nuclear Facilities.''

II. Additional Information

    The NRC published notice of the availability of DG-1386 in the 
Federal Register on May 22, 2023 (88 FR 32693), for a 30-day public 
comment period. The public comment period closed on June 21, 2023. 
Public comments on DG-1386 and the staff responses to the public 
comments are available under ADAMS under Accession No. ML23198A312.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Rules'' section of the 
Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under 1 CFR 
chapter I.

III. Congressional Review Act

    This RG is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has not 
found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act.

IV. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of RG 1.73 Revision 2, would not constitute backfitting as 
defined in Sec.  50.109 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(10 CFR), ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC Management Directive 
(MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, 
and Information Requests''; affect issue finality of any approval 
issued under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, Certificates, and Approvals 
for Nuclear Power Plants''; or constitute forward fitting as defined in 
MD 8.4, because, as explained in this RG, licensees would not be 
required to comply with the positions set forth in this RG.

V. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

II. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an amendment to Renewed Facility 
Operating License No. NPF-42, issued to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating 
Corporation, for operation of the Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 
1, located in Coffey County, Kansas.
    By letter dated August 31, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23165A250), 
the NRC issued Amendment No. 237 to Renewed Facility Operating License 
No. NPF-42 for the Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1. The amendment 
revised License Condition 2.C.(5), ``Fire Protection (Section 9.5.1, 
SER [Safety Evaluation Report], Section 9.5.1.8, SSER [Supplement to 
SER] #5),'' and the Updated Safety Analysis Report to allow the use of 
hard hat mounted portable lights as the primary emergency lighting 
means in certain fire areas for illuminating safe shutdown equipment, 
and access and egress routes to the equipment. By letter dated October 
19, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23292A357), Wolf Creek Nuclear 
Operating Corporation requested correction of the NRC staff safety 
evaluation (SE) for Amendment No. 237. Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating 
Corporation stated that it could not implement the amendment as 
described in the SE, and requested modification of the implementation 
date for Amendment No. 237. By letter dated November 29, 2023 (ADAMS 
Accession No. ML23299A266), the NRC issued Amendment No. 238 to extend 
the implementation date for Amendment No. 237 to February 27, 2024, as 
requested. By letter dated January 18, 2024 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML24018A248), Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation stated that 
additional time is necessary to implement Amendment No. 237, and 
requested modification of the implementation date from February 27, 
2024, to February 27, 2025.
    Before any issuance of the proposed license amendment, the NRC will 
need to make the findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), and NRC's regulations.
    The NRC has made a proposed determination that the license 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). 
Under the NRC's regulations in section 50.92 of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), this means that operation of the facility 
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or 
(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required 
by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue 
of NSHC, which is presented as follows:

    1. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed modification to provide an additional year for 
implementation for License Amendment Number 237 does not involve a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated. The existing Fire Protection Program 
will remain in effect during the modified implementation period.
    The current Fire Protection program and associated post-fire 
operator manual actions for a fire outside the control room will 
continue to remain feasible and reliable, demonstrating that the 
plant can be safely shutdown in the event of a fire. The use of the 
existing Fire Protection Program will not adversely affect the 
performance of operator manual actions in support of applicable 
procedures.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated.
    2. Does the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new 
or different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated?
    Response: No.
    The proposed modification to provide an additional year for 
implementation for License Amendment Number 237 does not create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously evaluated. The existing Fire Protection Program will 
remain in effect during the modified implementation period. 
Considering the current Fire Protection remains in place, no 
physical alteration of the plant will occur and does not result in 
the installation of any new or different kind of equipment.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility 
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated.
    3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction 
in a margin of safety?
    Response: No.
    The proposed modification to provide an additional year for 
implementation for License Amendment Number 237 is not a reduction 
in a margin of safety. The existing Fire Protection
    Program will remain in effect during the modified implementation 
period and has an acceptable margin of safety and has been approved 
by the NRC.
    Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant 
reduction in a margin of safety.

    The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on 
this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
license amendment request involves NSHC.
    The NRC is seeking public comments on this proposed determination 
that the license amendment request involves NSHC. Any comments received 
within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be 
considered in making any final determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice (the 
notice period). However, if circumstances change during the notice 
period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for 
example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may 
issue the license amendment before the expiration of the notice period, 
provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves 
NSHC. The final determination will consider all public and State 
comments received. If the Commission takes action prior to the 
expiration of either the comment period or the notice period, it will 
publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance. The Commission 
expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).

[[Page 5269]]

    If a hearing is requested and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of NSHC, the Commission will make a final 
determination on the issue of NSHC, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves NSHC, the Commission may issue the amendment and make 
it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. 
Any hearing would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the 
final determination is that the amendment request involves a 
significant hazards consideration, then any hearing held would take 
place before the issuance of the amendment unless the Commission finds 
an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, in which case 
it will issue an appropriate order or rule under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of an exemption from the 
requirements of paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of section 50.82 ``Termination 
of license,'' of part 50, ``Domestic Licensing of Production and 
Utilization Facilities,'' of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) and paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of 10 CFR 50.75, 
``Reporting and recordkeeping for decommissioning planning,'' to KS for 
Renewed Facility Operating License (RFOL) No. DPR-43 for KPS, located 
in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin. The exemption was submitted on March 29, 
2023, and supplemented on October 5, 2023, in response to a request for 
additional information from the NRC staff dated August 29, 2023, 
pertaining to the decommissioning trust fund (DTF) cash flows provided 
in the initial exemption request submittal.
    The exemption would permit KS to use funds from the KPS NDT for 
site restoration activities for KPS in the same manner that funds from 
the NDT are used under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) for decommissioning 
activities. The exemption request submitted by KPS was based on its 
analysis of the expected KPS decommissioning and site restoration 
costs, as provided in the KPS Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities 
Report (PSDAR), as supplemented, which was submitted by KS to the NRC 
on May 13, 2021.
    The exemption would also allow trust disbursements for site 
restoration activities to be made without prior notice to the NRC, 
which is consistent with a previous exemption allowing KS to use the 
KPS NDT for the management of spent fuel, and to allow trust 
disbursements for spent fuel management to be made without prior NRC 
notice, which was approved on May 21, 2014. The NRC staff's analysis 
will include evaluation of the KPS NDT in view of the prior exemption.
    Consistent with 10 CFR 51.21, ``Criteria for and identification of 
licensing and regulatory actions requiring environmental assessments,'' 
the NRC has determined that an EA is the appropriate form of 
environmental review for the requested action and prepared the 
following EA that analyzes the environmental impacts of the proposed 
action. Based on the results of the EA, which is provided in Section II 
of this document, and in accordance with paragraph (a) of 10 CFR 51.31, 
``Determinations based on environmental assessment,'' the NRC has 
determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the 
proposed action and is issuing a FONSI.

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action would partially exempt KS from the requirements 
set forth in 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv). 
Specifically, the proposed action would allow KS to use funds from the 
KPS NDT for site restoration activities not associated with 
radiological decommissioning activities and would exempt KS from the 
requirement for prior notification to the NRC for these withdrawals.
    The proposed action is in accordance with KS's application dated 
March 29, 2023, as supplemented by letter dated October 5, 2023.

Need for the Proposed Action

    By letter dated February 25, 2013, the previous holder of the KPS 
RFOL, Dominion Energy Kewaunee (DEK), submitted a certification to the 
NRC indicating it would permanently cease power operations at KPS on 
May 7, 2013. On May 7, 2013, DEK permanently ceased power operation at 
KPS. On May 14, 2013, DEK certified that it had permanently defueled 
the KPS reactor vessel.
    By letter dated March 29, 2023, as supplemented by letter dated 
October 5, 2023, KS requested an exemption to allow KPS NDT 
withdrawals, without prior written notification to the NRC, for site 
restoration activities for KPS.
    As required by 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A), decommissioning trust 
funds may be used by the licensee if the withdrawals are for legitimate 
decommissioning activity expenses, consistent with the definition of 
decommissioning in 10 CFR 50.2, ``Definitions.'' This definition 
addresses radiological decommissioning and does not include activities 
associated with site restoration. Similarly, the requirements of 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv) restrict the use of decommissioning trust fund 
disbursements (other than for ordinary and incidental expenses) to 
decommissioning expenses until final decommissioning has been 
completed. Therefore, exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 
CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) is needed to allow KS to use funds from the KPS NDT 
for site restoration activities for KPS.
    In the October 5, 2023, supplement to the exemption, KS stated that 
the KPS DTF Status Report demonstrates that the KPS NDT contains the 
funds needed to cover the estimated costs of KPS radiological 
decommissioning and license termination, as well as spent fuel 
management and site restoration activities. The supplemental 
information also provided additional details on license termination, 
spent fuel management, site restoration costs, and total forecasted 
expenditure data, based on the DECON decommissioning method and the 
current schedule of decommissioning activities for KPS.
    The adequacy of funds in the KPS NDT to cover the costs of 
activities associated with site restoration and radiological 
decommissioning through license termination is supported by the KS KPS 
PSDAR. To support site restoration activities not associated with 
radiological decommissioning, KS stated that it needs access to the 
funds in the KPS NDT in excess of those needed for radiological 
decommissioning.
    The requirements of 10 CFR 50.75(h)(1)(iv) further provide that, 
except for withdrawals being made under 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8) or for 
payments of ordinary administrative costs and other incidental expenses 
of the NDT in connection with the operation of the NDT, no disbursement 
may be made from the NDT without written notice to the NRC at least 30 
working days in advance. Therefore, an exemption from 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv) is also requested by KS to allow KS to use funds from 
the KPS NDT for spent fuel management and site restoration activities 
without prior NRC notification.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action involves an exemption from regulatory 
requirements that are of a financial or administrative nature and that 
do not have an impact on the environment. Before the NRC could approve 
the proposed action, it would have to conclude that there is reasonable 
assurance that adequate funds are available in the NDT to complete all 
activities associated with radiological decommissioning as well as 
spent fuel management and site restoration. Therefore, there would be 
no decrease in safety associated with the use of the NDT to also fund 
activities associated with site restoration.
    Section 50.82(a)(8)(v) of 10 CFR requires a licensee to submit a 
financial assurance status report annually between the time of 
submitting its site-specific decommissioning cost estimate and 
submitting its final radiation survey to demonstrate that residual 
radioactivity has been reduced to a level that permits termination of 
its license. Section 50.82(a)(8)(vi) of 10 CFR

[[Page 5001]]

requires that if the sum of the balance of any remaining 
decommissioning funds, plus expected rate of return, plus any other 
financial surety mechanism, does not cover the estimated cost to 
complete radiological decommissioning, additional financial assurance 
must be provided to cover the cost of completion. These annual reports 
provide a means for the NRC to continually monitor the adequacy of 
available funding. Since the exemption would allow KS to use funds from 
the KPS NDT that are in excess of those required for radiological 
decommissioning, the adequacy of the funds dedicated for radiological 
decommissioning would not be affected by the proposed exemption. 
Therefore, there is reasonable assurance that there would be no 
environmental impact due to lack of adequate funding for radiological 
decommissioning.
    The proposed action would not significantly increase the 
probability or consequences of radiological accidents. The proposed 
action has no direct radiological impacts. There would be no change to 
the types or amounts of radiological effluents that may be released; 
therefore, there would be no change in occupational or public radiation 
exposure from the proposed action. There are no materials or chemicals 
introduced into the plant that could affect the characteristics or 
types of effluents released offsite. In addition, the method of 
operation of waste processing systems would not be affected by the 
exemption. The proposed action would not result in changes to the 
design basis requirements of structures, systems, and components (SSCs) 
that function to limit or monitor the release of effluents. All the 
SSCs associated with limiting the release of effluents would continue 
to be able to perform their functions. Moreover, no changes would be 
made to plant buildings or the site property from the proposed action. 
Therefore, there are no significant radiological environmental impacts 
associated with the proposed action.
    With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed 
action would have no direct impacts on land use or water resources, 
including terrestrial and aquatic biota, as it involves no new 
construction or modification of plant operational systems. There would 
be no changes to the quality or quantity of nonradiological effluents 
and no changes to the plant's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination 
System permits would be needed. In addition, there would be no 
noticeable effect on socioeconomic conditions in the region, no 
environment justice impacts, no air quality impacts, and no impacts to 
historic and cultural resources from the proposed action. Therefore, 
there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts 
associated with the proposed action.
    Accordingly, the NRC concludes that there are no significant 
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC staff considered 
denial of the proposed action (i.e., the ``no-action'' alternative). 
Denial of the proposed action would result in no change in current 
environmental impacts. Therefore, the environmental impacts of the 
proposed action and the alternative action are similar.

Alternative Use of Resources

    There are no unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of 
available resources under the proposed action.

Agencies or Persons Consulted

    No additional agencies or persons were consulted regarding the 
environmental impact of the proposed action. On January 17, 2024, the 
State of Wisconsin representative was notified of this EA and FONSI.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    The requested exemption from 10 CFR 50.82(a)(8)(i)(A) and 10 CFR 
50.75(h)(1)(iv) would allow KS to use funds from the KPS NDT for site 
restoration activities for KPS, without prior written notification to 
the NRC. The proposed action would not significantly affect plant 
safety, would not have a significant adverse effect on the probability 
of an accident occurring, and would not have any significant 
radiological or nonradiological impacts. The proposed action involves 
an exemption from requirements that are of a financial or 
administrative nature and that would not have an impact on the human 
environment. Consistent with 10 CFR 51.21, the NRC conducted the EA for 
the proposed action, and this FONSI incorporates by reference the EA 
included in Section II of this document. Therefore, the NRC concludes 
that the proposed action will not have significant effects on the 
quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the NRC has determined 
not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed 
action.
    Other than KS's letter dated March 29, 2023, as supplemented by 
letter dated October 5, 2023, there are no other environmental 
documents associated with this review.
    Previous considerations regarding the environmental impacts of 
operating KPS are described in NUREG-1437, Supplement 40, ``Generic 
Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants: 
Regarding Kewaunee Power Station, Final Report,'' which provides the 
latest environmental review of current operations and description of 
environmental conditions at KPS.

II. Discussion

    By letter dated November 7, 2023 (ADAMS Accession No. ML23311A154), 
PG&E submitted to the NRC an application to renew the operating 
licenses for DCPP for an additional 20 years of operation. This 
submission initiated the NRC's proposed action of determining whether 
to grant the license renewal application. DCPP consists of two 
pressurized-water reactors designed by Westinghouse and is located in 
Avila Beach, California. The operating licenses for DCPP expire as 
follows: Unit 1 on November 2, 2024, and Unit 2 on August 26, 2025. The 
license renewal application was submitted pursuant to part 54, 
``Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Power 
Plants,'' of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR)

[[Page 4632]]

and seeks to extend the operating licenses for Units 1 and 2 to 
November 2, 2044, and August 26, 2045, respectively. A notice of 
receipt and availability of the application was published in the 
Federal Register on November 20, 2023 (88 FR 80780). A notice of 
acceptance for docketing of the application and of opportunity to 
request a hearing was published in the Federal Register on December 19, 
2023 (88 FR 87817) and is available on the Federal Rulemaking Website 
(https://www.regulations.gov) by searching for Docket ID NRC-2023-0192.

III. Request for Comment

    This notice informs the public of the NRC's intention to conduct 
environmental scoping and prepare an EIS related to the license renewal 
application for DCPP, and provides the public an opportunity to 
participate in the environmental scoping process, as defined in 10 CFR 
51.29, ``Scoping-environmental impact statement and supplement to 
environmental impact statement,'' and 10 CFR 51.116, ``Notice of 
intent.''
    The regulations in 36 CFR 800.8, ``Coordination with the National 
Environmental Policy Act,'' allow agencies to use their National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) 
(NEPA), process to fulfill the requirements of section 106 of the 
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (54 U.S.C. 
300101, et seq.) (NHPA). Therefore, pursuant to 36 CFR 800.8(c), the 
NRC intends to use its process and documentation required for the 
preparation of the EIS on the proposed action to comply with section 
106 of the NHPA in lieu of the procedures set forth at 36 CFR 800.3 
through 800.6.
    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.53(c) and 10 CFR 54.23, PG&E submitted 
an ER as part of the license renewal application for DCPP. The ER was 
prepared pursuant to 10 CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection 
Regulations for Domestic Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions,'' 
and is publicly available in ADAMS under Accession No. ML23311A154. The 
ER will also be available for viewing at https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/licensing/renewal/applications.html. In addition, the license 
renewal application, including the ER, is available for public review 
at the San Luis Obispo Library, 995 Palm St., San Luis Obispo, CA 
93403.
    The NRC intends to gather the information necessary to prepare a 
plant-specific supplement to NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental Impact 
Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants'' (ADAMS Package 
Accession No. ML13107A023) (GEIS), related to the license renewal 
application for DCPP. The NRC is required by 10 CFR 51.95 to prepare a 
plant-specific supplement to the GEIS in connection with the renewal of 
an operating license. This notice is being published in accordance with 
NEPA and the NRC's regulations at 10 CFR part 51.
    The supplement to the GEIS will evaluate the environmental impacts 
of license renewal for DCPP, and reasonable alternatives thereto. 
Possible alternatives to the proposed action include the no-action 
alternative and reasonable alternative energy sources.
    As part of its environmental review, the NRC will first conduct a 
scoping process for the plant-specific supplement to the GEIS and, as 
soon as practicable thereafter, will prepare a draft supplement to the 
GEIS for public comment. Participation in this scoping process by 
members of the public and local, State, Tribal, and Federal government 
agencies is encouraged. The scoping process for the supplement to the 
GEIS will be used to accomplish the following:
    a. Define the proposed action that is to be the subject of the 
supplement to the GEIS;
    b. Determine the scope of the supplement to the GEIS and identify 
the significant issues to be analyzed in depth;
    c. Identify and eliminate from detailed study those issues that are 
peripheral or are not significant or that have been covered by prior 
environmental review;
    d. Identify any environmental assessments and other ElSs that are 
being or will be prepared that are related to, but are not part of, the 
scope of the supplement to the GEIS under consideration;
    e. Identify other environmental review and consultation 
requirements related to the proposed action;
    f. Indicate the relationship between the timing of the preparation 
of the environmental analyses and the NRC's tentative planning and 
decision-making schedule;
    g. Identify any cooperating agencies and, as appropriate, allocate 
assignments for preparation and schedules for completing the supplement 
to the GEIS to the NRC and any cooperating agencies; and
    h. Describe how the supplement to the GEIS will be prepared, 
including any contractor assistance to be used.
    The NRC invites the following entities to participate in scoping:
    a. The applicant, PG&E;
    b. Any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by law or special 
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved or that is 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    c. Affected State and local government agencies, including those 
authorized to develop and enforce relevant environmental standards;
    d. Any affected Indian Tribe;
    e. Any person who requests or has requested an opportunity to 
participate in the scoping process; and
    f. Any person who has petitioned or intends to petition for leave 
to intervene under 10 CFR 2.309.

IV. Public Scoping Meeting

    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.26(b), the scoping process for an EIS 
may include a public scoping meeting to help identify significant 
issues related to the proposed action and to determine the scope of 
issues to be addressed in the EIS.
    The NRC is announcing that it will hold an online webinar and 
teleconference call and an in-person public scoping meeting for the 
DCPP license renewal supplement to the GEIS. The online webinar and 
teleconference call will be held on February 1, 2024, at 10 a.m. PT. 
The in-person public scoping meeting will be held on February 8, 2024, 
at 6 p.m. PT. A court reporter will transcribe all comments received 
during the public scoping meetings. To be considered, comments must be 
provided either at a transcribed public meeting or in writing, as 
discussed in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. Persons interested 
in attending these meetings should monitor the NRC's Public Meeting 
Schedule website at https://www.nrc.gov/pmns/mtg for additional 
information and agenda for the meetings. Please contact Kim Conway no 
later than January 31, 2024, if accommodations or special equipment is 
needed to attend or to provide comments, so that the NRC can determine 
whether the request can be accommodated.
    The public scoping meetings will include: (1) an overview by the 
NRC of the environmental and safety review processes, the proposed 
scope of the supplement to the GEIS, and the proposed review schedule; 
and (2) the opportunity for interested government agencies, 
organizations, and individuals to submit comments or suggestions on 
environmental issues or the proposed scope of the supplement to the 
GEIS.

II. Background

    Under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. chapter 35), the NRC recently submitted a request for renewal of 
an existing collection of information to OMB for review entitled, ``10 
CFR part 81, `Standard Specification for the Granting of Patent 
Licenses.''' The NRC hereby informs potential respondents that an 
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and that a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently 
valid OMB control number.
    The NRC published a Federal Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on September 18, 2023, 88 FR 
63981.
    1. The title of the information collection: Part 81 of title 10 of 
the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Standard Specification for 
the Granting of Patent Licenses.''
    2. OMB approval number: 3150-0121.
    3. Type of submission: Extension.
    4. The form number, if applicable: Not applicable.
    5. How often the collection is required or requested: Applications 
for licenses are submitted once. Other reports are submitted annually, 
or as other events require.
    6. Who will be required or asked to respond: Applicants for and 
holders of NRC licenses to NRC inventions.
    7. The estimated number of annual responses: 3.5.
    8. The estimated number of annual respondents: 10.
    9. The estimated number of hours needed annually to comply with the 
information collection requirement or request: 10; however, no 
applications are anticipated during the next 3 years.
    10. Abstract: As specified in 10 CFR part 81, the NRC may grant 
nonexclusive licenses or limited exclusive licenses to its patented 
inventions to responsible applicants. Applicants for licenses to NRC 
inventions are required to provide information which may provide the 
basis for granting the requested license. In addition, all license 
holders must submit periodic reports on efforts to bring the invention 
to a point of practical application and the extent to which they are 
making the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the 
public. Exclusive license holders must submit additional information if 
they seek to extend their licenses, issue sublicenses, or transfer the 
licenses. In addition, if requested, exclusive license holders must 
promptly supply to the United States Government copies of all pleadings 
and other papers filed in any patent infringement lawsuit, as well as 
evidence from proceedings relating to the licensed patent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NRC has granted the request of Holtec 
Decommissioning International, LLC and Holtec Palisades, LLC (hereafter 
collectively referred to as the licensee), to withdraw its September 
14, 2022, application (ADAMS Accession No. ML22257A097) for proposed 
amendment to the Renewed Facility Operating License (RFOL) No. DPR-20 
for the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades), located in Covert 
Township, Van Buren County, Michigan.
    The proposed license amendment would have revised the Palisades 
RFOL to remove the Cyber Security Plan (CSP) requirements contained in 
License Condition 2.E. This change was requested to support the 
decommissioning of Palisades. The license amendment proposed to revise 
the Palisades RFOL to remove the CSP requirements contained in License 
Condition 2.E. once Palisades spent fuel underwent a sufficient cooling 
period that would mitigate the risk of heat-up to clad ignition 
temperature within 10 hours.
    The Commission had previously issued a proposed finding that the 
amendment involves no significant hazards consideration, which was 
published in the Federal Register on November 29, 2022 (87 FR 73339), 
and there were no public comments on that finding or hearing requests 
with respect to the action. However, by letter dated December 12, 2023 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23346A083), the licensee withdrew the proposed 
amendment.

    Dated: January 11, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Discussion

    In 1990, Congress passed the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act of 1990 (FCPIAA) to provide for regular adjustments for 
inflation of civil monetary penalties (CMPs). As amended by the Debt 
Collection Improvement Act of 1996, the FCPIAA required that the head 
of each Federal agency review and, if necessary, adjust by regulation 
the CMPs assessed under statutes enforced by the agency at least once 
every 4 years.
    On November 2, 2015, the President of the United States signed into 
law the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements 
Act of 2015 (the 2015 Improvements Act), which further amended the 
FCPIAA and requires Federal agencies to adjust their CMPs annually for 
inflation no later than January 15 of each year. The requirements of 
the 2015 Improvements Act apply to the NRC's maximum CMP amounts for 1) 
a violation of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, or any 
regulation or order issued under the AEA, codified in Sec.  2.205(j) of 
title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Civil 
penalties''; and 2) a false claim or statement made under the Program 
Fraud Civil Remedies Act, codified in 10 CFR 13.3, ``Basis for civil 
penalties and assessments.''
    Pursuant to the 2015 Improvements Act, the NRC published today in 
the Rules section of the Federal Register the revised maximum daily 
base CMP, based on the percentage change in the consumer price index 
between October 2021 and October 2022, and codified in 10 CFR 2.205(j). 
In connection with this final rule, the NRC is publishing a 
corresponding update to the NRC's Enforcement Policy to adjust the 
monetary amounts listed in Section 8.0, ``Table of Base Civil 
Penalties.'' This monetary adjustment does not include the base civil 
penalty amounts listed in item f. because those values are based on the 
estimated or actual costs of authorized disposal and are not calculated 
based on the maximum daily base CMP codified in 10 CFR 2.205(j). 
Adjustments to item f. base civil penalty amounts are being examined 
under a separate effort.
    Accordingly, the NRC has revised its Enforcement Policy to read as 
follows:

                    8.0 Table of Base Civil Penalties
                                [Table A]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Power reactors, gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment         $360,000
 plants, and high-level waste repository................
b. Fuel fabricators authorized to possess Category I or          180,000
 II quantities of SNM and uranium conversion facilities.
c. All other fuel fabricators, including facilities               90,000
 under construction, authorized to possess Category III
 quantities of SNM, industrial processors, independent
 spent fuel and monitored retrievable storage
 installations, mills, gas centrifuge and laser uranium
 enrichment facilities..................................
d. Test reactors, contractors, waste disposal licensees,          36,000
 industrial radiographers, and other large material

     (tritium)..........................................
    2. Other sources or devices containing the materials          17,000
     and quantities listed in 10 CFR 31.5(c)(13)(i).....
    3. Sources and devices not otherwise described above           7,000

II. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement

    This policy statement does not contain any new or amended 
collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq). Existing collections of information were 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), approval numbers 
3150-0010 and 3150-0136.

Public Protection Notification

    The NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information unless the document requesting 
or requiring the collection displays a currently valid OMB control 
number.

III. Congressional Review Act

    This action is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review Act (5 
U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget has 
determined that it is not a ``major rule'' as defined by the 
Congressional Review Act.

Adjustment of Civil Penalties for Inflation for Fiscal Year 2024

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its 
regulations to adjust the maximum civil monetary penalties it can 
assess under statutes enforced by the agency. These changes are 
mandated by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 
1990, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment 
Act Improvements Act of 2015. The NRC is amending its regulations to 
adjust the maximum civil monetary penalty for a violation of the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or any regulation or order issued under 
the Atomic Energy Act from $351,424 to $362,814 per violation, per day. 
Additionally, the NRC is amending provisions concerning program fraud 
civil penalties by adjusting the maximum civil monetary penalty under 
the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act from $13,508 to $13,946 for each 
false claim or statement.

DATES: This final rule is effective on January 12, 2024.

I. Background

    Congress passed the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment 
Act of 1990 (FCPIAA) to allow for regular adjustment for inflation of 
civil monetary penalties (CMPs), maintain the deterrent effect of such 
penalties and promote compliance with the law, and improve the 
collection of CMPs by the Federal government (Pub L. 101-410, 104 Stat. 
890; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note). Pursuant to this authority, and as amended 
by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-34, 110 
Stat. 1321-373), the NRC increased via rulemaking the CMP amounts for 
violations of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (AEA) (codified 
at Sec.  2.205 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
``Civil penalties'') and Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (codified at 
Sec.  13.3, ``Civil penalties and assessments'') on four occasions 
between 1996 and 2008.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Adjustment of Civil Penalties for Inflation (73 FR 54671; 
Sept. 23, 2008); Adjustment of Civil Penalties for Inflation (69 FR 
62393; Oct. 26, 2004); Adjustment of Civil Penalties for Inflation; 
Miscellaneous Administrative Changes (65 FR 59270; Oct. 4, 2000); 
Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties for Inflation (61 FR 53554; 
Oct. 11, 1996). An adjustment was not performed in 2012 because the 
FCPIAA at the time required agencies to round their CMP amounts to 
the nearest multiple of $1,000 or $10,000, depending on the size of 
the CMP amount, and the 2012 percentages based on the statutory 
formula were small enough that no adjustment resulted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On November 2, 2015, Congress amended the FCPIAA through the 
Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 
2015 (2015 Improvements Act) (Sec. 701, Pub. L. 114-74, 129 Stat. 599). 
The 2015 Improvements Act required that the head of each agency perform 
an initial ``catch-up'' adjustment via

[[Page 2113]]

rulemaking, adjusting the CMPs enforced by that agency according to the 
percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) between the month 
of October 2015 and the month of October of the calendar year when the 
CMP amount was last established by Congress. The NRC published this 
catch-up rulemaking on July 1, 2016 (81 FR 43019).
    The 2015 Improvements Act also requires that the head of each 
agency continue to adjust CMP amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar, 
on an annual basis. Specifically, each CMP is to be adjusted based on 
the percentage change between the CPI for the month of October, and the 
CPI for the month of October for the previous year. The NRC most 
recently adjusted its civil penalties for inflation according to this 
statutory formula on January 13, 2023 (88 FR 2188). This year's 
adjustment is based on the increase in the CPI from October 2022 to 
October 2023.

II. Discussion

    Section 234 of the AEA limits civil penalties for violations of the 
AEA to $100,000 per day, per violation (42 U.S.C. 2282). However, as 
discussed in Section I, ``Background,'' of this document, the NRC has 
increased this amount several times since 1996 per the FCPIAA, as 
amended. Using the formula in the 2015 Improvements Act, the $351,424 
amount last established in January 2023 will increase by 3.241 percent, 
resulting in a new CMP amount of $362,814. This is based on the 
increase in the CPI from October 2022 (298.012) to October 2023 
(307.671). Therefore, the NRC is amending Sec.  2.205 to reflect a new 
maximum CMP under the AEA in the amount of $362,814 per day, per 
violation. This represents an increase of $11,390.
    Monetary penalties under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act were 
established in 1986 at $5,000 per claim (Pub. L. 99-509, 100 Stat. 
1938; 31 U.S.C. 3802). The NRC also has adjusted this amount (currently 
set at $13,508) multiple times pursuant to the FCPIAA, as amended, 
since 1996. Using the formula in the 2015 Improvements Act, the $13,508 
amount last established in January 2023 will also increase by 3.241 
percent, resulting in a new CMP amount of $13,946. Therefore, the NRC 
is amending Sec.  13.3 to reflect a new maximum CMP amount of $13,946 
per claim or statement. This represents an increase of $438.
    As permitted by the 2015 Improvements Act, the NRC may apply these 
increased CMP amounts to any penalties assessed by the agency after the 
effective date of this final rule (January 15, 2024), regardless of 
whether the associated violation occurred before or after this date 
(Pub. L. 114-74, 129 Stat. 600; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note). The NRC assesses 
civil penalty amounts for violations of the AEA based on the class of 
licensee and severity of the violation, in accordance with the NRC 
Enforcement Policy, which is available under ADAMS Accession No. 
ML23333A447. A corresponding update to the NRC Enforcement Policy is 
being published today in the Rules section of the Federal Register to 
reflect the updated CMP amount in Sec.  2.205.

III. Rulemaking Procedure

    The 2015 Improvements Act expressly exempts this final rule from 
the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act 
by directing agencies to adjust CMPs for inflation ``notwithstanding 
section 553 of title 5, United States Code'' (Pub. L. 114-74, 129 Stat. 
599; 28 U.S.C. 2461 note). As such, this final rule is being issued 
without prior public notice or opportunity for public comment, with an 
effective date of January 12, 2024.

IV. Section-by-Section Analysis

Section 2.205 Civil Penalties

    This final rule revises paragraph (j) by replacing ``$351,424'' 
with ``$362,814.''

Section 13.3 Basis for Civil Penalties and Assessments

    This final rule revises paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (b)(1)(ii) by 
replacing ``$13,508'' with ``$13,946.''

V. Regulatory Analysis

    This final rule adjusts for inflation the maximum CMPs the NRC may 
assess under the AEA and under the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 
1986. The formula for determining the amount of the adjustment is 
mandated by Congress in the FCPIAA, as amended by the 2015 Improvements 
Act (codified at 28 U.S.C. 2461 note). Congress passed this legislation 
on the basis of its findings that the power to impose monetary civil 
penalties is important to deterring violations of Federal law and 
furthering the policy goals of Federal laws and regulations. Congress 
has also found that inflation diminishes the impact of these penalties 
and their effect. The principal purposes of this legislation are to 
provide for adjustment of civil monetary penalties for inflation, 
maintain the deterrent effect of civil monetary penalties, and promote 
compliance with the law. Therefore, these are the anticipated impacts 
of this rulemaking. Direct monetary impacts fall only upon licensees or 
other persons subjected to NRC enforcement for violations of the AEA 
and regulations and orders issued under the AEA (Sec.  2.205), or those 
licensees or persons subjected to liability pursuant to the provisions 
of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (31 U.S.C. 3801-3812) 
and the NRC's implementing regulations (10 CFR part 13).

VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to regulations for 
which a Federal agency is not required by law, including the rulemaking 
provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), to 
publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 604). As 
discussed in this notice under Section III, ``Rulemaking Procedure,'' 
of this document, this final rule is exempt from the requirements of 5 
U.S.C. 553(b) and notice and comment need not be provided. Accordingly, 
the NRC also determines that the requirements of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act do not apply to this final rule.

VII. Backfit and Issue Finality

    The NRC has not prepared a backfit analysis for this final rule. 
This final rule does not involve any provision that would impose a 
backfit, nor is it inconsistent with any issue finality provision, as 
those terms are defined in 10 CFR chapter I. As mandated by Congress, 
this final rule increases CMP amounts for violations of already-
existing NRC regulations and requirements. This final rule does not 
modify any licensee systems, structures, components, designs, 
approvals, or procedures required for the construction or operation of 
any facility.

VIII. Plain Writing

    The Plain Writing Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-274) requires Federal 
agencies to write documents in a clear, concise, and well-organized 
manner. The NRC has written this document to be consistent with the 
Plain Writing Act as well as the Presidential Memorandum, ``Plain 
Language in Government Writing,'' published June 10, 1998 (63 FR 
31885).

IX. National Environmental Policy Act

    The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action 
described as a categorical exclusion in Sec.  51.22(c)(1). Therefore, 
neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental 
assessment has been prepared for this final rule.

X. Paperwork Reduction Act

    This final rule does not contain a collection of information as 
defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) 
and, therefore,

[[Page 2114]]

is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995.

XI. Congressional Review Act

    This final rule is a rule as defined in the Congressional Review 
Act (5 U.S.C. 801-808). However, the Office of Management and Budget 
has not found it to be a major rule as defined in the Congressional 
Review Act.

program fee decrease.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will decrease 
the current fee of $35 assessed to applicants and licensees for 
criminal history records checks to $32. This fee is necessary to 
recover the full cost for the administration of the Criminal History 
Program (CHP). Information regarding this change can be found on the 
NRC's CHP public website at https://www.nrc.gov/security/chp.html.

DATES: The fee decrease will begin on February 1, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    Pursuant to requirements in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 
1990 (31 U.S.C. 902(a)(8)), the NRC conducts biennial reviews of the 
fees assessed to applicants and licensees for criminal history records 
checks. Specifically, the purpose of these reviews is to determine the 
suitability of fees to cover the costs charged by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and the costs of NRC to administer the program. The 
latest biennial review was completed on September 14, 2023. As a result 
of this review, the Chief Financial Officer approved a decrease in fees 
to be implemented in fiscal year 2024.

ll. Discussion

    During this biennial review cycle, the NRC was able to identify 
contract cost savings and obtain more accurate cost information for 
supporting CHP services (e.g., associated Electronic Information 
Exchange costs) that can be passed on to applicants and licensees. 
Accordingly, the NRC will decrease the current fee of $35 assessed to 
applicants and licensees for criminal history records checks to $32. 
This fee is the sum of the user fee charged by the FBI ($11.25 
effective January 1, 2019) plus NRC's direct and indirect costs 
incurred in processing fingerprints.
    As a reminder, payment is due upon fingerprint card submission, and 
the NRC's preferred method of payment is through Pay.gov at https://www.pay.gov, which includes payment by debit or credit card or 
electronic funds transfer (e-check). Although electronic payment is 
preferred, the NRC will also accept cashier checks or money orders made 
payable to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission through September 30, 
2024. Effective October 1, 2024, the NRC will only accept electronic 
payment methods. Fingerprint cards along with proof of payment should 
be sent to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Director, Division of 
Physical and Cyber Security Policy, Attn: Criminal History Program/Mail 
Stop--T-07D04M, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-2738.

II. Discussion

    The NRC is issuing for public comment a draft environmental impact 
statement (DEIS), published as NUREG-1437, Supplement 7a, Second 
Renewal, ``Site-Specific Environmental Impact Statement for License 
Renewal of Nuclear Plants Regarding Subsequent License Renewal for 
North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2, Draft Report for Comment.'' The 
DEIS supersedes a draft supplemental environmental impact statement 
(DSEIS) published as NUREG-1437, Supplement 7, Second Renewal, 
``Generic Environmental Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear 
Plants, Supplement 7, Second Renewal, Regarding Subsequent License 
Renewal for North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2, Draft Report for 
Comment'' (ADAMS Accession No. ML21228A084) published for comment on 
August 25, 2021 (86 FR 47525).
    The DEIS supersedes the August 2021 DSEIS and includes the NRC 
staff's site-specific evaluation of the environmental impacts of 
subsequent license renewal (SLR) for North Anna for each of the 
environmental issues that were previously dispositioned as Category 1 
issues (generic to all or a distinct subset of nuclear power plants) in 
the August 2021 DSEIS consistent with the list of Category 1 issues in 
Table B-1 in appendix B to subpart A of title 10 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (10 CFR) part 51 and NUREG-1437, ``Generic Environmental 
Impact Statement for License Renewal of Nuclear Plants,'' Revision 1, 
Final Report (June 2013). The DEIS considers information contained in 
the Virginia Electric and Power Company (Dominion, the applicant) 
September 28, 2022, submittal, which supplemented its environmental 
report in Dominion's 2020 SLR application. The DEIS also considers 
whether there is significant new information that would change the NRC 
staff's conclusions concerning Category 2 issues (specific to 
individual nuclear power plants) in the August 2021 DSEIS. The NRC 
staff prepared the DEIS in accordance with the Commission's decisions 
in Commission Legal Issuance (CLI)-22-02 (ADAMS Accession No. 
ML22055A496) and CLI-22-03 (ADAMS Accession No. ML22055A527), both 
dated February 24, 2022. Based on the site-specific evaluation provided 
in the DEIS, the NRC staff's preliminary recommendation is that the 
adverse environmental impacts of SLR for North Anna (i.e., the 
continued operation of North Anna for a period of 20 years beyond the 
current renewed license expiration dates) are not so great that 
preserving the option of SLR for energy-planning decision-makers would 
be unreasonable. The NRC staff based its recommendation on the 
applicant's environmental report, as supplemented, the NRC staff's 
consultations with Federal, State, Tribal, and local government 
agencies, the NRC staff's independent environmental review, as 
documented in the DEIS, and the NRC staff's consideration of public 
comments.

III. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To 
Intervene

    As the Commission directed in CLI-22-03, a new notice of 
opportunity to request a hearing and petition for leave

[[Page 962]]

to intervene--limited to contentions based on new information discussed 
in the DEIS--is being issued.
    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by this action may 
file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to intervene 
(petition) with respect to the action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult 10 CFR 
2.309. If a petition is filed, the presiding officer will rule on the 
petition and, if appropriate, a notice of hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    A State, local governmental body, federally recognized Native 
American Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to 
the Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, federally recognized 
Native American Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party 
under 10 CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

IV. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
federally recognized Native American Tribe, or designated agency 
thereof that requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be 
filed in accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that provides access to the document 
to the NRC's Office of the General Counsel and any others who have 
advised the Office of the Secretary that they wish to participate in 
the proceeding, so that the filer need not serve the document on those 
participants separately. Therefore, applicants and other participants 
(or their counsel or representative) must apply for and receive a 
digital ID certificate before adjudicatory documents are filed to 
obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.

II. Additional Information

    The NRC is issuing for public comment a DG in the NRC's 
``Regulatory Guide'' series. This series was developed to describe 
methods that are acceptable to the NRC staff for implementing specific 
parts of the agency's regulations, to explain techniques that the staff 
uses in evaluating specific issues or postulated events, and to 
describe information that the staff needs in its review of applications 
for permits and licenses.
    The DG, entitled ``Installation Design and Installation of Vented 
Lead-Acid Storage Batteries for Production and Utilization 
Facilities,'' is temporarily identified by its task number, DG-1421 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML23277A276).
    This revision of the guide (Revision 3) endorses, with 
clarifications, IEEE Std. 484-2019 and applies to production and 
utilization facilities licensed under part 50 and part 52 of title 10 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) within the scope of this 
RG. The previous version of this RG (ADAMS Accession No. ML070080013) 
endorsed, with certain clarifications, IEEE Std. 484-2002. In 2019, the 
IEEE revised IEEE Std. 484 to add information on thermal factors of 
influence (exposure temperature, ambient temperature, temperature 
gradient, and rate of temperature change) and safety provisions (e.g., 
electrical hazards, shock hazards, ground fault hazards, arc flash 
hazards, chemical hazards), modifications to the personal protective 
equipment section, major changes to mounting and ventilation sections, 
new provisions on connection to direct current systems and spare cells, 
and new provisions for material handling and hazard assessment, as well 
as many other updates, corrections, and clarifications to various 
sections. The revised IEEE standard also provides two new normative 
annexes.

[[Page 896]]

    The staff is also issuing for public comment a draft regulatory 
analysis (ADAMS Accession No. ML23277A279). The staff developed a 
regulatory analysis to assess the value of issuing or revising a 
regulatory guide as well as alternative courses of action.
    As noted in the Federal Register on December 9, 2022 (87 FR 75671), 
this document is being published in the ``Proposed Rules'' section of 
the Federal Register to comply with publication requirements under 1 
CFR chapter I.

III. Backfitting, Forward Fitting, and Issue Finality

    Issuance of DG-1421, if finalized, would not constitute backfitting 
as defined in 10 CFR 50.109, ``Backfitting,'' and as described in NRC 
Management Directive (MD) 8.4, ``Management of Backfitting, Forward 
Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information Requests''; affect the issue 
finality of an approval issued under 10 CFR part 52, ``Licenses, 
Certifications, and Approvals for Nuclear Power Plants''; or constitute 
forward fitting as that term is defined and described in MD 8.4, 
because, as explained in this DG, licensees would not be required to 
comply with the positions set forth in this DG.

IV. Submitting Suggestions for Improvement of Regulatory Guides

    A member of the public may, at any time, submit suggestions to the 
NRC for improvement of existing RGs or for the development of new RGs. 
Suggestions can be submitted on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/reg-guides/contactus.html. 
Suggestions will be considered in future updates and enhancements to 
the ``Regulatory Guide'' series.

Attachment--Exemption

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Docket No. 50-255

Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC, and Holtec Palisades, LLC; 
Palisades Nuclear Plant Exemption

I. Background

    By letter dated October 19, 2017 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System Accession No. ML17292A032), Entergy Nuclear 
Operations, Inc. (ENOI) certified to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC, or Commission) that it planned to permanently cease 
power operations at the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades) no later 
than May 31, 2022. On May 20, 2022, ENOI permanently ceased power 
operations at Palisades, and by letter dated June 13, 2022 
(ML22164A067), ENOI certified to the NRC that the fuel was permanently 
removed from the Palisades reactor vessel and placed in the spent fuel 
pool (SFP) on June 10, 2022. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraphs 
50.82(a)(2) of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
the 10 CFR part 50 renewed facility operating license for Palisades no 
longer authorizes operation of the reactor or emplacement or retention 
of fuel in the reactor vessel. The facility is still authorized to 
possess, and store irradiated (i.e., spent) nuclear fuel. Palisades 
spent fuel is currently stored in the SFP and in dry cask storage at 
the independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI).

II. Request/Action

    By letter dated October 26, 2022 (ML22299A059), Holtec 
Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), one of the licensees of 
Palisades and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holtec 
International (Holtec), requested an exemption on behalf of Holtec 
Palisades, LLC, the other Palisades licensee, from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) 
concerning offsite primary and secondary liability insurance. HDI and 
Holtec Palisades, LLC, are hereafter collectively referred to as the 
licensee. The exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) would permit the 
licensee to reduce the required level of primary offsite liability 
insurance from $450 million to $100 million and to eliminate the 
requirement to carry secondary financial protection for Palisades.
    The regulation at 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) requires licensees to have 
and maintain primary financial protection in an amount of $450 million. 
In addition, licensees are required to participate in an industry 
retrospective rating plan (secondary financial protection) that commits 
licensees to pay into an insurance pool to be used for damages that may 
exceed primary insurance coverage. Participation in the industry 
retrospective rating plan will subject the licensee to deferred premium 
charges up to a maximum total deferred premium of $131,056,000 with 
respect to any nuclear incident at any operating nuclear power plant 
and up to a maximum annual deferred premium of $20,496,000 per 
incident.
    Many of the accident scenarios postulated in the updated safety 
analysis reports for operating power reactors involve failures or 
malfunctions of systems, which could affect the fuel in the reactor 
core and, in the most severe postulated accidents, would involve the 
release of large quantities of fission products. With the permanent 
cessation of power operations at Palisades and the permanent removal of 
the fuel from the reactor vessel, many accidents are no longer 
possible. Similarly, the associated risk of offsite liability damages 
that would require insurance or indemnification is commensurately lower 
for permanently shutdown and defueled plants. Therefore, the licensee 
requested an exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to permit a reduction 
in primary offsite liability insurance and to withdraw from 
participation in the industry retrospective rating plan.

III. Discussion

    Pursuant to 10 CFR 140.8, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission 
may, upon application of any interested person or upon its own 
initiative, grant such exemptions from the requirements of the 
regulations in 10 CFR part 140 when the exemptions are authorized by 
law and are otherwise in the public interest. The NRC staff has 
reviewed the

[[Page 484]]

licensee's request for an exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) and has 
concluded that the requested exemption is authorized by law and is 
otherwise in the public interest.
    The Price Anderson Act of 1957 (PAA) requires that nuclear power 
reactor licensees have insurance to compensate the public for damages 
arising from a nuclear incident. Specifically, the PAA requires 
licensees of facilities with a ``rated capacity of 100,000 electrical 
kilowatts or more'' to maintain the maximum amount of primary offsite 
liability insurance commercially available (currently $450 million) and 
a specified amount of secondary insurance coverage (currently up to 
$131,056,000 per reactor). In the event of an accident causing offsite 
damages in excess of $450 million, each licensee would be assessed a 
prorated share of the excess damages, up to $131,056,000 per reactor, 
for a total of approximately $13 billion per nuclear incident. The 
NRC's regulations at 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) implement these PAA insurance 
requirements and set forth the amount of primary and secondary 
insurance each power reactor licensee must have.
    As noted above, the PAA requirements with respect to primary and 
secondary insurance and the implementing regulations at 10 CFR 
140.11(a)(4) apply to licensees of facilities with a ``rated capacity 
of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more.'' In accordance with 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(2), the license for a power reactor no longer authorizes 
operation of the reactor or emplacement or retention of fuel into the 
reactor vessel upon the docketing of the certifications for permanent 
cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor 
vessel. Therefore, the reactor cannot be used to generate power.
    Accordingly, a reactor that is undergoing decommissioning has no 
``rated capacity.'' Therefore, the NRC may take the reactor licensee 
out of the category of reactor licensees that are required to maintain 
the maximum available insurance and to participate in the secondary 
retrospective insurance pool.
    The financial protection limits of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) were 
established to require licensees to maintain sufficient insurance, as 
specified under the PAA, to satisfy liability claims by members of the 
public for personal injury, property damage, and the legal cost 
associated with lawsuits as the result of a nuclear accident at an 
operating reactor with a rated capacity of 100,000 kilowatts electric 
or greater. Therefore, the insurance levels established by this 
regulation, as required by the PAA, were associated with the risks and 
potential consequences of an accident at an operating reactor with a 
rated capacity of 100,000 kilowatts electric or greater.
    The legal and associated technical basis for granting exemptions 
from 10 CFR part 140 is set forth in SECY-93-127, ``Financial 
Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During 
Decommissioning,'' dated May 10, 1993 (ML12257A628). The legal analysis 
underlying SECY-93-127 concluded that, upon a technical finding that 
lesser potential hazards exist after permanent cessation of power 
operations (and the reactor having no ``rated capacity''), the 
Commission has the discretion under the PAA to reduce the amount of 
insurance required of a licensee undergoing decommissioning.
    As a technical matter, the fact that a reactor has permanently 
ceased power operations is not itself determinative as to whether a 
licensee may cease providing the offsite liability coverage required by 
the PAA and 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4). In light of the presence of freshly 
discharged irradiated fuel in the SFP at a recently shutdown reactor, 
the potential for an offsite radiological release from a zirconium fire 
with consequences comparable in some respects to an operating reactor 
accident remains. That risk is very low at the time of reactor shutdown 
because of design provisions that prevent a significant reduction in 
coolant inventory in the SFP under normal and accident conditions and 
becomes no longer credible once the continual reduction in decay heat 
provides ample time to restore coolant inventory and permits air 
cooling in a drained SFP.
    After that time, the probability of a large offsite radiological 
release from a zirconium fire is negligible for permanently shutdown 
reactors, but the SFP is still operational and an inventory of 
radioactive materials still exists onsite. Therefore, an evaluation of 
the potential for offsite damage is necessary to determine the 
appropriate level of offsite insurance post shutdown in accordance with 
the Commission's discretionary authority under the PAA to establish an 
appropriate level of required financial protection for such permanently 
shutdown facilities.
    The NRC staff has conducted an evaluation and concluded that, aside 
from the handling, storage, and transportation of spent fuel and 
radioactive materials for a permanently shutdown and defueled reactor, 
no reasonably conceivable potential accident exists that could cause 
significant offsite damage. During normal power reactor operations, the 
forced flow of water through the reactor coolant system (RCS) removes 
heat generated by the reactor. The RCS transfers this heat away from 
the reactor core by converting reactor feedwater to steam which then 
flows to the main turbine generator to produce electricity. Most of the 
accident scenarios postulated for operating power reactors involve 
failures or malfunctions of systems that could affect the fuel in the 
reactor core, which in the most severe postulated accidents, would 
involve the release of large quantities of fission products. With the 
permanent cessation of reactor operations at Palisades and the 
permanent removal of the fuel from the reactor core, such accidents are 
no longer possible. The reactor, RCS, and supporting systems no longer 
operate and have no function related to the storage of the irradiated 
fuel. Therefore, postulated accidents involving failure or malfunction 
of the reactor, RCS, or supporting systems are no longer applicable.
    During reactor decommissioning, the principal radiological risks 
are associated with the storage of spent fuel onsite. On a case-by-case 
basis, licensees undergoing decommissioning have been granted 
permission to reduce the required amount of primary offsite liability 
insurance coverage from $450 million to $100 million and to withdraw 
from the secondary insurance pool. One of the technical criteria for 
granting the exemption is that the possibility of a design-basis event 
that could cause significant offsite damage has been significantly 
reduced.
    The NRC staff performed an evaluation of the design-basis accidents 
(DBAs) for Palisades being permanently defueled as part of SECY-23-
0043, ``Request by Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC for 
Exemptions from Certain Emergency Planning Requirements for Palisades 
Nuclear Plant,'' dated May 15, 2023 (ML23054A179). The licensee has 
stated, and the NRC staff agrees, that while spent fuel remains in the 
SFP, the only postulated DBAs that would remain applicable to Palisades 
in the permanently defueled condition that could contribute a 
significant dose is a fuel handling accident (FHA) in the Fuel Handling 
Building, where the SFP is located; a liquid waste incident; a waste 
gas incident and a postulated cask drop accident. For completeness, the 
NRC staff also evaluated the applicability of other DBAs documented in 
the Palisades Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) 
(ML21125A344) to ensure that these accidents would not have 
consequences that could potentially exceed the 10

[[Page 485]]

CFR 50.67 dose limits and Regulatory Guide 1.183, ``Alternative 
Radiological Source Terms for Evaluating Design Basis Accidents at 
Nuclear Power Reactors,'' dose acceptance criteria or approach the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) early phase protective action 
guides (PAGs).
    The NRC staff previously approved the revised DBA radiological 
consequence analyses in License Amendment No. 272, ``Palisades Nuclear 
Plant--Issuance of Amendment No. 272 Re: Permanently Defueled Technical 
Specifications (EPID L-2021-LLA-0099),'' dated May 13, 2022 
(ML22039A198). As documented in the NRC's safety evaluation for License 
Amendment No. 272, the NRC staff determined that 17 days is the amount 
of time needed for decay to meet the EPA early phase PAG limit of 1 rem 
total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) at the exclusion area boundary 
(EAB). In using the same assumptions, except for decay time, the 
licensee's dose analysis for an FHA with 60 days of decay in the SFP 
results in a dose of 0.014 rem TEDE at the EAB. This result meets the 
6.3 rem acceptance criteria of RG 1.183 at the EAB and low population 
zone. In addition, it also meets the EPA early phase PAG criterion of 1 
rem TEDE and below 10 percent EPA PAG threshold for declaration of a 
site area emergency.
    The licensee has determined that after a decay time of at least 60 
days after shutdown, the FHA doses would decrease to a level that would 
not warrant protective actions under the EPA early phase PAG framework, 
notwithstanding meeting the dose limit requirements under 10 CFR 50.67 
and dose acceptance criteria under Regulatory Guide 1.183. The NRC 
staff notes that the doses from an FHA are dominated by the isotope 
Iodine-131. Palisades permanently ceased power operations on May 20, 
2022. After over a year of decay, the thyroid dose from an FHA would be 
negligible. The only isotope remaining in significant amounts, among 
those postulated to be released in a design-basis FHA, would be 
Krypton-85. Since Krypton-85 primarily decays by beta emission, the 
calculated skin dose from an FHA release would make an insignificant 
contribution to the total effective dose equivalent, which is the 
parameter of interest in the determination of the EPA early phase PAGs 
for sheltering or evacuation. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that 
the dose consequences from an FHA for the permanently shutdown 
Palisades facility would not approach the EPA early phase PAG 
criterion.
    The NRC staff reviewed the consequences of an FHA, liquid waste 
incident, waste gas incident, and postulated cask drop accident in 
detail during the review of previously approved license amendment 
requests and exemptions from various emergency planning requirements 
for Palisades and found them to be acceptable. Since this technical 
information has not changed in relation to this exemption request, the 
NRC staff relied on these previous conclusions to conduct portions of 
the review for this exemption request. The NRC staff notes that while 
the licensee continues to rely on the information from previously 
approved licensing actions, the calculated doses would be expected to 
be lower when this exemption is implemented due to additional decay 
time beyond the time assumed in the previously approved actions. 
Therefore, any offsite consequence from a design-basis radiological 
release is highly unlikely and, therefore, a significant amount of 
offsite liability insurance coverage is not required.
    The only beyond design-basis event that has the potential to lead 
to a significant radiological release at a permanently shutdown and 
defueled reactor is a zirconium fire. The zirconium fire scenario is a 
postulated, but highly unlikely, accident scenario that involves the 
loss of water inventory from the SFP resulting in a significant heatup 
of the spent fuel and culminating in substantial zirconium cladding 
oxidation and fuel damage. The probability of a zirconium fire scenario 
is related to the decay heat of the irradiated fuel stored in the SFP. 
Therefore, the risks from a zirconium fire scenario continue to 
decrease as a function of the time that Palisades has been permanently 
shutdown.
    The licensee performed an analysis demonstrating that 12 months 
after Palisades permanently shut down, the spent fuel stored in the SFP 
will have decayed to the extent that the requested exemption may be 
implemented at Palisades. Given Palisades' permanent shutdown date was 
May 20, 2022, and the fuel decay time of 12 months, May 31, 2023, 
terminates the period during which the spent fuel could heat-up to clad 
ignition temperature within 10 hours under adiabatic conditions. This 
analysis, ``Holtec Spent Fuel Pool Calculation,'' dated July 8, 2022, 
[non-public], was submitted as Attachment 1 by the licensee in support 
of the letter dated July 11, 2022 (ML22192A134), in which the licensee 
requested exemptions from specific portions of 10 CFR 50.47 and 
appendix E to 10 CFR part 50 for the Palisades license. The analysis 
determined the decay time necessary to ensure a minimum of 10 hours is 
available before the fuel cladding temperature of the hottest fuel 
assembly in the SFP reaches 900 [deg]C. This 10-hour minimum threshold 
provides sufficient time for the licensee to take mitigative actions, 
and, if necessary, for offsite agencies to take appropriate action to 
protect the health and safety of the public if fuel and cladding 
oxidation occurs in air.
    The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's calculation to verify that 
important physical properties of materials were within acceptable 
ranges and that the results were accurate. The NRC staff determined 
that the physical properties of materials were appropriate in the 
licensee's calculations related to SFP heatup considerations for 
Palisades. Therefore, the NRC staff found that 12 months after 
permanent cessation of power operations, more than 10 hours would be 
available before a significant offsite release could begin. The NRC 
staff concluded that the adiabatic heatup calculation provided an 
acceptable method for determining the minimum time available for 
deployment of mitigation equipment and, if necessary, implementing 
measures under a comprehensive general emergency plan. In this regard, 
one technical criterion for relieving decommissioning reactor licensees 
from the insurance obligations applicable to an operating reactor is a 
finding that the heat generated by the SFP has decayed to the point 
where the possibility of a zirconium fire is highly unlikely.
    This was addressed in SECY-93-127, where the NRC staff concluded 
that there was a low likelihood and reduced short-term public health 
consequences of a zirconium fire once a decommissioning plant's spent 
fuel has sufficiently decayed. In its Staff Requirements Memorandum, 
``Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power 
Plants during Decommissioning,'' dated July 13, 1993 (ML003760936), the 
Commission approved a policy that authorized, through the exemption 
process, withdrawal from participation in the secondary insurance layer 
and a reduction in commercial liability insurance coverage to $100 
million when a licensee is able to demonstrate that the spent fuel 
could be air-cooled if the SFP was drained of water.
    The NRC staff has used this technical criterion to grant similar 
exemptions to other decommissioning reactors (e.g., Pilgrim Nuclear 
Power Station, published in the Federal Register on January 14, 2020 
(85 FR 1827); Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 1,

[[Page 486]]

published in the Federal Register on March 26, 2021 (86 FR 14472); and 
Duane Arnold Energy Center, published in the Federal Register on May 
18, 2021 (86 FR 26961)). Additional discussions of other 
decommissioning reactor licensees that have received exemptions to 
reduce their primary insurance level to $100 million are provided in 
SECY-96-256, ``Changes to the Financial Protection Requirements for 
Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors, 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 
140.11,'' dated December 17, 1996 (ML15062A483). These prior exemptions 
were based on the licensee demonstrating that the SFP could be air-
cooled consistent with the technical criterion discussed above.
    In the exemption request dated October 26, 2022, the licensee 
compared the Palisades fuel storage parameters with those used in NRC 
generic evaluations of fuel cooling included in NUREG/CR-6451, ``A 
Safety and Regulatory Assessment of Generic BWR [Boiling-Water Reactor] 
and PWR [Pressurized-Water Reactor] Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power 
Plants,'' dated August 1997 (ML082260098). The analysis described in 
NUREG/CR-6451 determined that natural air circulation would adequately 
cool fuel that has decayed for 17 months after operation in a typical 
PWR. The licensee compared the post-shutdown fuel storage conditions 
with those assumed for the analysis presented in NUREG/CR-6451.
    The licensee found that the Palisades fuel storage configuration is 
smaller than the values modeled in NUREG/CR-6451. However, these 
differences are considered to be conservatively offset by the lower 
power density of the Palisades fuel assemblies, substantially larger 
downcomer areas for improved buoyancy driven air flow and natural 
circulation, and the fewer number of fuel assemblies that are stored in 
the fuel racks as compared to the NUREG/CR-6451 PWR model. Therefore, 
the cooling air flow should be comparable.
    In SECY-00-0145, ``Integrated Rulemaking Plan for Nuclear Power 
Plant Decommissioning,'' dated June 28, 2000, and SECY-01-0100, 
``Policy Issues Related to Safeguards, Insurance, and Emergency 
Preparedness Regulations at Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants 
Storing Fuel in Spent Fuel Pools,'' dated June 4, 2001 (ML003721626 and 
ML011450420, respectively), the NRC staff discussed additional 
information concerning SFP zirconium fire risks at decommissioning 
reactors and associated implications for offsite insurance. Analyzing 
when the spent fuel stored in the SFP is capable of adequate air-
cooling is one measure that demonstrates when the probability of a 
zirconium fire would be exceedingly low.
    The NRC staff has determined that the licensee's proposed reduction 
in primary offsite liability coverage to a level of $100 million and 
the licensee's proposed withdrawal from participation in the secondary 
insurance pool for offsite financial protection are consistent with the 
policy established in SECY-93-127 and subsequent insurance 
considerations resulting from zirconium fire risks, as discussed in 
SECY-00-0145 and SECY-01-0100. The NRC has previously determined in 
SECY-00-0145 that the minimum offsite financial protection requirement 
may be reduced to $100 million and that secondary insurance is not 
required once it is determined that the spent fuel in the SFP is no 
longer thermal-hydraulically capable of sustaining a zirconium fire 
based on a plant-specific analysis. The NRC staff also notes that 
similar exemptions from these insurance requirements have been granted 
to other permanently shutdown and defueled power reactors upon 
satisfactory demonstration that zirconium fire risk from the irradiated 
fuel stored in the SFP is of negligible concern.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    The PAA and its implementing regulations in 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) 
require licensees of nuclear reactors that have a rated capacity of 
100,000 kilowatts electric or more to have and maintain $450 million in 
primary financial protection and to participate in a secondary 
retrospective insurance pool. In accordance with 10 CFR 140.8, the 
Commission may grant exemptions from the regulations in 10 CFR part 140 
as the Commission determines are authorized by law. The legal and 
associated technical basis for granting exemptions from 10 CFR part 140 
are set forth in SECY-93-127. The legal analysis underlying SECY-93-127 
concluded that, upon a technical finding that lesser potential hazards 
exist after permanent cessation of operations, the Commission has the 
discretion under the PAA to reduce the amount of insurance required of 
a licensee undergoing decommissioning.
    Based on its review of the exemption request, the NRC staff 
concludes that the technical criteria for relieving Holtec Palisades 
and HDI from their existing primary and secondary insurance obligations 
have been met. As explained above, the NRC staff has concluded that no 
reasonably conceivable DBA exists that could cause an offsite release 
greater than the EPA PAGs and, therefore, that any offsite consequence 
from a design-basis radiological release is highly unlikely and the 
need for a significant amount of offsite liability insurance coverage 
is unwarranted. Additionally, the NRC staff determined that, after 12 
months decay, the fuel stored in the Palisades SFP will be capable of 
being adequately cooled by air in the highly unlikely event of pool 
drainage. Moreover, in the highly unlikely beyond DBA scenario where 
the SFP water inventory is lost in such a manner that all methods of 
heat removal from the spent fuel are no longer available, the NRC staff 
has determined that at least 10 hours would be available and is 
sufficient time to support deployment of mitigation equipment, 
consistent with plant conditions, to prevent the zirconium cladding 
from reaching a point of rapid oxidation. Therefore, the NRC staff 
concludes that the fuel stored in the Palisades SFP will have decayed 
sufficiently by the requested effective date for the exemption of 12 
months after permanent cessation of power operations to support a 
reduction in the required insurance consistent with SECY-00-0145.
    The NRC staff has determined that granting the licensee's proposed 
exemption will not result in a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, Section 170, or other laws, as amended, which require licensees 
to maintain adequate financial protection. Accordingly, consistent with 
the legal standard presented in SECY-93-127, under which 
decommissioning reactor licensees may be relieved of the requirements 
to carry the maximum amount of insurance available and to participate 
in the secondary retrospective premium pool where there is sufficient 
technical justification, the NRC staff concludes that the requested 
exemption is authorized by law.

B. The Exemption Is Otherwise in the Public Interest

    The financial protection limits of 10 CFR 140.11 were established 
to require licensees to maintain sufficient offsite liability insurance 
to ensure adequate funding for offsite liability claims following an 
accident at an operating reactor. However, the regulation does not 
consider the reduced potential for and consequence of nuclear incidents 
at permanently shutdown and decommissioning reactors.
    The basis provided in SECY-93-127, SECY-00-0145, and SECY-01-0100 
allows licensees of decommissioning plants to reduce their primary 
offsite liability insurance and to withdraw

[[Page 487]]

from participation in the retrospective rating pool for deferred 
premium charges. As discussed in these documents, once the zirconium 
fire concern is determined to be negligible, possible accident scenario 
risks at permanently shutdown and defueled reactors are greatly reduced 
when compared to the risks at operating reactors and the associated 
potential for offsite financial liabilities from an accident are 
commensurately less. The licensee analyzed and the NRC staff confirmed 
that the risks of accidents that could result in an offsite 
radiological release are minimal, which justifies the proposed 
reductions in offsite primary liability insurance and withdrawal from 
participation in the secondary retrospective rating pool for deferred 
premium charges.
    Additionally, participation in the secondary retrospective rating 
pool could potentially have adverse consequences on the safe and timely 
completion of decommissioning. If a nuclear incident sufficient to 
trigger the secondary insurance layer occurred at another nuclear power 
plant, the licensee could incur financial liability of up to 
$131,056,000. However, because Palisades is permanently shutdown, it 
cannot produce revenue from electricity generation sales to cover such 
a liability. Therefore, such liability if subsequently incurred could 
significantly affect the ability of the facility to conduct and 
complete timely radiological decontamination and decommissioning 
activities. In addition, as SECY-93-127 concluded, the shared financial 
risk exposure to the licensee is greatly disproportionate to the 
radiological risk posed by Palisades when compared to operating 
reactors. The reduced overall risk to the public at decommissioning 
power plants does not warrant that the licensee be required to carry 
full operating reactor insurance coverage after the requisite spent 
fuel cooling period has elapsed following final reactor shutdown.
    The licensee's proposed financial protection limits will maintain a 
level of liability insurance coverage commensurate with the risk to the 
public. These changes are consistent with previous NRC policy as 
discussed in SECY-00-0145 and exemptions approved for other 
decommissioning reactors. Therefore, the underlying purpose of the 
regulations will not be adversely affected by the reductions in 
insurance coverage. Accordingly, an exemption from participation in the 
secondary insurance pool and a reduction in the primary insurance to 
$100 million, a value more in line with the potential consequences of 
accidents, would be in the public interest in that this ensures that 
there will be adequate funds to address any of those consequences and 
helps to ensure the safe and timely decommissioning of the reactor.
    Therefore, the NRC staff has concluded that an exemption from 10 
CFR 140.11(a)(4), which would permit Holtec Palisades and HDI to lower 
the Palisades primary insurance levels and to withdraw from the 
secondary retrospective premium pool at the requested effective date of 
12 months after permanent cessation of power operations, is in the 
public interest.

C. Environmental Considerations

    The NRC's approval of an exemption from insurance or indemnity 
requirements belongs to a category of actions that the Commission, by 
rule or regulation, has declared to be a categorical exclusion after 
first finding that the category of actions does not individually or 
cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. 
Specifically, the exemption is categorically excluded from the 
requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or environmental 
impact statement in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22(c)(25).
    Under 10 CFR 51.22(c)(25), granting of an exemption from the 
requirements of any regulation of Chapter I to 10 CFR is a categorical 
exclusion provided that: (i) there is no significant hazards 
consideration; (ii) there is no significant change in the types or 
significant increase in the amounts of any effluents that may be 
released offsite; (iii) there is no significant increase in individual 
or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure; (iv) there is 
no significant construction impact; (v) there is no significant 
increase in the potential for or consequences from radiological 
accidents; and (vi) the requirements from which an exemption is sought 
involve surety, insurance, or indemnity requirements.
    As the Director of the Division of Decommissioning, Uranium 
Recovery, and Waste Programs in the NRC's Office of Nuclear Material 
Safety and Safeguards, I have determined that approval of the exemption 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, as defined in 10 
CFR 50.92, because reducing the licensee's offsite liability 
requirements at Palisades does not: (1) involve a significant increase 
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; 
(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from 
any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant 
reduction in a margin of safety. The exempted financial protection 
regulation is unrelated to the operation of Palisades or site 
activities. Accordingly, there is no significant change in the types or 
significant increase in the amounts of any effluents that may be 
released offsite and no significant increase in individual or 
cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure. The exempted 
regulation is not associated with construction so there is no 
significant construction impact. The exempted regulation does not 
concern the source term (i.e., potential amount of radiation in an 
accident) nor any activities conducted at the site. Therefore, there is 
no significant increase in the potential for, or consequences of, a 
radiological accident. In addition, there would be no significant 
impacts to biota, water resources, historic properties, cultural 
resources, or socioeconomic conditions in the region resulting from 
issuance of the requested exemption. The requirement for offsite 
liability insurance involves surety, insurance, or indemnity matters 
only.
    Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b) and 51.22(c)(25), no 
environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared in connection with the approval of this exemption request.

IV. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
140.8, the exemption is authorized by law and is otherwise in the 
public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Holtec 
Palisades and HDI an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 
140.11(a)(4) for Palisades. Palisades permanently ceased power 
operations on May 20, 2022. The exemption from 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) 
permits Palisades to reduce the required level of primary financial 
protection from $450 million to $100 million and to withdraw from 
participation in the secondary layer of financial protection 12 months 
after permanent cessation of power operations, which was May 20, 2023. 
Because this period had already elapsed, the exemption is effective 
upon issuance.

    Dated: this 22nd day of December 2023.

Attachment--Exemption

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Docket No. 50-255

Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC, and Holtec Palisades, LLC; 
Palisades Nuclear Plant, Exemption

I. Background

    By letter dated October 19, 2017 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System Accession No. ML17292A032), Entergy Nuclear 
Operations, Inc. (ENOI) certified to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC, or Commission) that it planned to permanently cease 
power operations at the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades) no later 
than May 31, 2022. On May 20, 2022, ENOI permanently ceased power 
operations at Palisades, and by letter dated June 13, 2022 
(ML22164A067), ENOI certified to the NRC that the fuel was permanently 
removed from the Palisades reactor vessel and placed in the spent fuel 
pool (SFP) on June 10, 2022. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraphs 
50.82(a)(2) of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
the 10 CFR part 50 renewed facility operating license for Palisades no 
longer authorizes operation of the reactor or emplacement or retention 
of fuel in the reactor vessel. The facility is still authorized to 
possess, and store irradiated (i.e., spent) nuclear fuel. Palisades 
spent fuel is currently stored in the SFP and in dry cask storage at 
the independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI).

II. Request/Action

    By letter dated October 26, 2022 (ML22299A062), Holtec 
Decommissioning International, LLC (HDI), one of the licensees of 
Palisades and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holtec 
International (Holtec), requested an exemption on behalf of Holtec 
Palisades, LLC, the other Palisades licensee, from 10 CFR 50.54(w)(1) 
concerning onsite liability insurance. HDI and Holtec Palisades, LLC, 
are hereafter collectively referred to as the licensee. The exemption 
from 10 CFR 50.54(w)(1) would permit the licensee to reduce the 
required level of onsite property damage insurance from $1.06 billion 
to $50 million for Palisades.
    The regulation at 10 CFR 50.54(w)(1) requires licensees to have and 
maintain onsite property damage insurance to stabilize and 
decontaminate the reactor and reactor site in the event of an accident. 
The onsite insurance coverage must be either $1.06 billion or whatever 
amount of insurance is generally available from private sources 
(whichever is less).
    The licensee states that the risk of an incident at a permanently 
shutdown and defueled reactor is much less than the risk from an 
operating power reactor. In addition, since reactor operation is no 
longer authorized at Palisades, there are no events that would require 
the stabilization of reactor conditions after an accident. Similarly, 
the risk of an accident that would result in significant onsite 
contamination at Palisades is also much lower than the risk of such an 
event at operating reactors. Therefore, the licensee requested an 
exemption from 10 CFR 50.54(w)(1) to reduce its onsite property damage 
insurance from $1.06 billion to $50 million, commensurate with the 
reduced risk of an incident at the permanently shutdown and defueled 
Palisades site.

III. Discussion

    Under 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any 
interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from the 
requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized 
by law, will not present an undue risk to public health or safety, and 
are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) any of the 
special circumstances listed in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2) are present.
    The financial protection limits of 10 CFR 50.54(w)(1) were 
established after the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 2 
accident out of concern that licensees may be unable to financially 
cover onsite cleanup costs in the event of a major nuclear accident. 
The specified $1.06 billion coverage amount requirement was developed 
based on an analysis of an accident at a nuclear reactor operating at 
power, resulting in a large fission product release and requiring 
significant resource expenditures to stabilize the reactor and 
ultimately decontaminate and cleanup the site.
    These cost estimates were developed based on the spectrum of 
postulated accidents for an operating nuclear reactor. Those costs were 
derived from the consequences of a release of radioactive material from 
the reactor. Although the risk of an accident at an operating reactor 
is very low, the consequences onsite and offsite can be significant. In 
an operating plant, the high temperature and pressure of the reactor 
coolant system (RCS) and the inventory of relatively short-lived 
radionuclides contribute to both the risk and consequences of an 
accident. With the permanent cessation of reactor operations at 
Palisades and the permanent removal of the fuel from the reactor 
vessel, such accidents are no longer possible. As a result, the reactor 
vessel, RCS, and supporting systems no longer operate and have no 
function related to the storage of the irradiated fuel. Therefore, 
postulated accidents involving failure or malfunction of the reactor, 
RCS, or supporting systems are no longer applicable.
    During reactor decommissioning, the largest radiological risks are 
associated with the storage of spent fuel onsite. In the exemption 
request dated October 26, 2022, the licensee discussed both design-
basis and beyond design-basis events involving irradiated fuel stored 
in the SFP. The licensee determined that there are no possible design-
basis events at Palisades that could result in an offsite radiological 
release exceeding the limits established by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's (EPA) early phase Protective Action Guides (PAGs) 
of 1 roentgen equivalent man (rem) at the exclusion area boundary, as a 
way to demonstrate that any possible radiological releases would be 
minimal and would not require precautionary protective actions (e.g., 
sheltering in place or evacuation).

[[Page 420]]

    The NRC staff evaluated the radiological consequences associated 
with various decommissioning activities and the design-basis accidents 
(DBAs) at Palisades in consideration of a permanently shutdown and 
defueled condition. The possible DBA scenarios at Palisades have 
greatly reduced radiological consequences. Based on its review, the NRC 
staff concluded that no reasonably conceivable DBA exists that could 
cause an offsite release greater than the EPA PAGs.
    The only incident that has the potential to lead to a significant 
radiological release at a decommissioning reactor is a zirconium fire. 
The zirconium fire scenario is a postulated, but highly unlikely, 
beyond DBA scenario that involves loss of water inventory from the SFP 
resulting in a significant heatup of the spent fuel and culminating in 
substantial zirconium cladding oxidation and fuel damage. The 
probability of a zirconium fire scenario is related to the decay heat 
of the irradiated fuel stored in the SFP. Therefore, the risks from a 
zirconium fire scenario continue to decrease as a function of the time 
since Palisades has been permanently shutdown.
    The Commission has previously authorized a lesser amount of onsite 
financial protection based on this analysis of the zirconium fire risk. 
In SECY-96-256, ``Changes to Financial Protection Requirements for 
Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Reactors, 10 CFR 50.54(w) and 10 CFR 
140.11,'' dated December 17, 1996 (ML15062A483), the NRC staff 
recommended changes to the power reactor financial protection 
regulations that would allow licensees to lower onsite insurance levels 
to $50 million upon demonstration that the fuel stored in the SFP can 
be air-cooled. In its Staff Requirements Memorandum to SECY-96-256, 
dated January 28, 1997 (ML15062A454), the Commission supported the NRC 
staff's recommendation that, among other things, would allow 
permanently shutdown power reactor licensees to reduce commercial 
onsite property damage insurance coverage to $50 million when the 
licensee was able to demonstrate the technical criterion that the spent 
fuel could be air-cooled if the SFP was drained of water.
    The NRC staff has used this technical criterion to grant similar 
exemptions to other decommissioning reactors (e.g., Pilgrim Nuclear 
Power Station, published in the Federal Register on January 14, 2020 
(85 FR 2153); Three Mile Island Nuclear Station, Unit 1, published in 
the Federal Register on March 26, 2021 (86 FR 16241); and Duane Arnold 
Energy Center, published in the Federal Register on May 18, 2021 (86 FR 
26946)). These prior exemptions were based on these licensees 
demonstrating that the SFP could be air-cooled, consistent with the 
technical criterion discussed above.
    In its October 26, 2022 request, the licensee compared Palisades 
fuel storage parameters with those used in NRC generic evaluations of 
fuel cooling included in NUREG/CR-6451, ``A Safety and Regulatory 
Assessment of Generic BWR [Boiling-Water Reactor] and PWR [Pressurized-
Water Reactor] Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated 
August 1997 (ML082260098). The analysis described in NUREG/CR-6451 
determined that natural air circulation would adequately cool fuel that 
has decayed for 17 months after operation in a typical PWR. The 
licensee compared the post-shutdown fuel storage conditions with those 
assumed for the analysis presented in NUREG/CR-6451.
    In SECY-00-0145, ``Integrated Rulemaking Plan for Nuclear Power 
Plant Decommissioning,'' dated June 28, 2000, and SECY-01-0100, 
``Policy Issues Related to Safeguards, Insurance, and Emergency 
Preparedness Regulations at Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants 
Storing Fuel in Spent Fuel Pools,'' dated June 4, 2001 (ML003721626 and 
ML011450420, respectively), the NRC staff discussed additional 
information concerning SFP zirconium fire risks at decommissioning 
reactors and associated implications for onsite property damage 
insurance. Providing an analysis of when the spent fuel stored in the 
SFP is capable of air-cooling is one measure that can be used to 
demonstrate that the probability of a zirconium fire is exceedingly 
low. However, the NRC staff has more recently used an additional 
analysis that bounds an incomplete drain down of the SFP water, or some 
other catastrophic event (such as a complete drainage of the SFP with 
rearrangement of spent fuel rack geometry and/or the addition of rubble 
to the SFP). The analysis postulates that decay heat transfer from the 
spent fuel via conduction, convection, or radiation would be impeded. 
This analysis is often referred to as an adiabatic heatup.
    In its exemption dated October 26, 2022, the licensee stated, and 
the NRC staff confirmed, that the bounding analyses for the Palisades 
SFP for beyond design basis events demonstrate that 12 months after 
shutdown of Palisades a minimum of 10 hours is available before the 
fuel cladding temperature of the hottest fuel assembly in the SFP 
reaches 900 [deg]C with a complete loss of SFP water inventory. This 
analysis, ``Holtec Spent Fuel Pool Calculations,'' dated July 8, 2022, 
[non-public] was submitted as Attachment 1 by the licensee in support 
of the letter dated July 11, 2022 (ML22192A134), in which the licensee 
requested exemptions from specific portions of 10 CFR 50.47 and 
appendix E to 10 CFR part 50 for the Palisades license.
    As stated in NUREG-1738, ``Technical Study of Spent Fuel Pool 
Accident Risk at Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated February 
2001 (ML010430066), 900 [deg]C is an acceptable temperature to use for 
assessing the onset of fission product release, where the SFP is 
drained and air cooling is not possible; at least 10 hours would be 
available from the time spent fuel cooling is lost until the hottest 
fuel assembly reaches a temperature of 900 [deg]C. The 10-hour 
criterion, conservatively, does not consider the time to uncover the 
fuel and assumes instantaneous loss of cooling to the fuel. The 10-hour 
time period is also not intended to represent the time that it would 
take to repair all key safety systems or to repair a large SFP breach. 
The 10-hour criterion is a conservative period of time in which pre-
planned mitigation measures to provide makeup water or spray to the SFP 
can be reliably implemented before the onset of a zirconium cladding 
ignition. In addition, in the unlikely event that a release is 
projected to occur, 10 hours would provide sufficient time for offsite 
agencies, if deemed warranted, to take appropriate action to protect 
the health and safety of the public.
    In the NRC staff's evaluation contained in SECY-23-0043, ``Request 
by Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC for Exemptions from 
Certain Emergency Planning Requirements for Palisades Nuclear Plant,'' 
dated May 15, 2023 (ML23054A179), the NRC staff assessed the licensee's 
accident analyses associated with the radiological risks from a 
zirconium fire at a permanently shutdown and defueled Palisades after 
12 months of fuel decay. For the highly unlikely beyond design-basis 
accident scenario where the SFP coolant inventory is lost in such a 
manner that all methods of heat removal from the spent fuel are no 
longer available, the NRC staff found that there will be a minimum of 
10 hours from the initiation of the accident until the cladding reaches 
a temperature where offsite radiological release might occur. The NRC 
staff finds that 10 hours is sufficient time to support deployment of 
mitigation equipment, consistent with

[[Page 421]]

plant conditions, to prevent the zirconium cladding from reaching a 
point of rapid oxidation. As a result, the likelihood that such a 
scenario would progress to a zirconium fire is deemed not credible.
    However, the NRC staff has postulated that there is still a 
potential for other radiological incidents at a decommissioning reactor 
that could result in significant onsite contamination besides a 
zirconium fire. In SECY-96-256, the NRC staff cited the rupture of a 
large, contaminated liquid storage tank (~450,000 gallons) causing soil 
contamination and potential groundwater contamination as the costliest 
postulated event to decontaminate and remediate (other than an SFP 
zirconium fire). The postulated large liquid radiological waste storage 
tank rupture event was determined to have a bounding onsite cleanup 
cost of approximately $50 million. Therefore, the NRC staff determined 
that the licensee's proposal to reduce onsite insurance to a level of 
$50 million would be consistent with the bounding cleanup and 
decontamination cost, as discussed in SECY-96-256, to account for the 
postulated rupture of a large liquid radiological waste tank at the 
Palisades site, should such an event occur.
    The NRC staff has determined that the licensee's proposed reduction 
in onsite property damage insurance coverage to a level of $50 million 
is consistent with SECY-96-256 and subsequent insurance considerations 
resulting from additional zirconium fire risks as discussed in SECY-00-
0145 and SECY-01-0100, as well as NUREG/CR-6451 and NUREG-1738. In 
addition, the NRC staff notes that similar exemptions have been granted 
to other permanently shutdown and defueled power reactors, upon 
demonstration that the criterion of the zirconium fire risks from the 
irradiated fuel stored in the SFP is of negligible concern.

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    The requested exemption from 10 CFR 50.54(w)(1) would allow the 
licensee to reduce the minimum coverage limit for onsite property 
damage insurance. As stated above, 10 CFR 50.12 allows the NRC to grant 
exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when the exemptions 
are authorized by law.
    As explained above, the NRC staff has determined that the 
licensee's proposed reduction in onsite property damage insurance 
coverage to a level of $50 million is consistent with SECY-96-256. 
Moreover, the NRC staff concluded that 12 months after the permanent 
cessation of power operations, sufficient irradiated fuel decay time 
will have elapsed at Palisades to decrease the probability of an onsite 
and offsite radiological release from a postulated zirconium fire 
accident to negligible levels. In addition, the licensee's proposal to 
reduce onsite insurance to a level of $50 million is consistent with 
the maximum estimated cleanup costs for the recovery from the rupture 
of a large liquid radiological waste storage tank.
    The NRC staff has determined that granting the licensee's proposed 
exemption will not result in a violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, or the Commission's regulations. Therefore, based on 
its review of the licensee's exemption request as discussed above, and 
consistent with SECY-96-256, the NRC staff concludes that the exemption 
is authorized by law.

B. The Exemption Presents No Undue Risk to the Public Health and Safety

    The onsite property damage insurance requirements of 10 CFR 
50.54(w)(1) were established to provide financial assurance that 
following a significant nuclear incident, onsite conditions could be 
stabilized and the site decontaminated. The requirements of 10 CFR 
50.54(w)(1) and the existing level of onsite insurance coverage for 
Palisades are predicated on the assumption that the reactor is 
operating. However, Palisades was permanently shut down on May 20, 
2022, and defueled on June 10, 2022. The permanently shutdown and 
defueled status of the facility results in a significant reduction in 
the number and severity of potential accidents and, correspondingly, a 
significant reduction in the potential for and severity of onsite 
property damage. The proposed reduction in the amount of onsite 
insurance coverage does not impact the probability or consequences of 
potential accidents. The proposed level of insurance coverage is 
commensurate with the reduced consequences of potential nuclear 
accidents at Palisades. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that 
granting the requested exemption will not present an undue risk to the 
health and safety of the public.

C. The Exemption Is Consistent With the Common Defense and Security

    The proposed exemption would not eliminate any requirements 
associated with physical protection of the site and would not adversely 
affect the licensee's ability to physically secure the site or protect 
special nuclear material. Physical security measures at Palisades are 
not affected by the requested exemption. Therefore, the proposed 
exemption is consistent with the common defense and security.

D. Special Circumstances

    Special circumstances, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), 
are present whenever application of the regulation in the particular 
circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the 
regulation. The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.54(w)(1) is to provide 
reasonable assurance that adequate funds will be available to stabilize 
reactor conditions and cover onsite cleanup costs associated with site 
decontamination following an accident that results in the release of a 
significant amount of radiological material. Since Palisades 
permanently shut down on May 20, 2022, and defueled on June 10, 2022, 
it is no longer possible for the radiological consequences of DBAs or 
other credible events at Palisades to exceed the limits of the EPA PAGs 
at the exclusion area boundary.
    The licensee has evaluated the consequences of highly unlikely, 
beyond-design-basis conditions involving a loss of inventory from the 
SFP. The analyses show that 12 months after the permanent cessation of 
power operations on May 20, 2022, the likelihood of such an event 
leading to a large radiological release is negligible. The NRC staff's 
evaluation of the licensee's analyses confirms this conclusion.
    The NRC staff also finds that the licensee's proposed $50 million 
level of onsite insurance is consistent with the bounding cleanup and 
decontamination cost as discussed in SECY-96-256 to account for the 
hypothetical rupture of a large liquid radiological waste tank at the 
Palisades site should such an event occur. Therefore, the NRC staff 
concludes that the application of the current requirements in 10 CFR 
50.54(w)(1) to maintain $1.06 billion in onsite insurance coverage is 
not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule for the 
permanently shutdown and defueled Palisades reactor.
    Under 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(iii), special circumstances are present 
whenever compliance would result in undue hardship or other costs that 
are significantly in excess of those contemplated when the regulation 
was adopted, or that are significantly in excess of those incurred by 
others similarly situated.
    The NRC staff concludes that if the licensee was required to 
continue to maintain an onsite insurance level of

[[Page 422]]

$1.06 billion, the associated insurance premiums would be in excess of 
those necessary and commensurate with the radiological contamination 
risks posed by the site. In addition, such insurance levels would be 
significantly in excess of other decommissioning reactor facilities 
that have been granted similar exemptions by the NRC.
    The NRC staff finds that compliance with the existing rule would 
result in an undue hardship or other costs that are significantly in 
excess of those contemplated when the regulation was adopted and are 
significantly in excess of those incurred by others similarly situated. 
Therefore, the special circumstances required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) 
and 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(iii) exist.

E. Environmental Considerations

    The NRC's approval of an exemption from insurance or indemnity 
requirements belongs to a category of actions that the Commission, by 
rule or regulation, has declared to be a categorical exclusion after 
first finding that the category of actions does not individually or 
cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. 
Specifically, the exemption is categorically excluded from the 
requirement to prepare an environmental assessment or environmental 
impact statement in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22(c)(25).
    Under 10 CFR 51.22(c)(25), granting of an exemption from the 
requirements of any regulation of Chapter I to 10 CFR is a categorical 
exclusion provided that: (i) there is no significant hazards 
consideration; (ii) there is no significant change in the types or 
significant increase in the amounts of any effluents that may be 
released offsite; (iii) there is no significant increase in individual 
or cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure; (iv) there is 
no significant construction impact; (v) there is no significant 
increase in the potential for or consequences from radiological 
accidents; and (vi) the requirements from which an exemption is sought 
involve surety, insurance, or indemnity requirements.
    As the Director of the Division of Decommissioning, Uranium 
Recovery, and Waste Programs in the NRC's Office of Nuclear Material 
Safety and Safeguards, I have determined that approval of the exemption 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, as defined in 10 
CFR 50.92, because reducing the licensee's onsite property damage 
insurance for Palisades does not: (1) involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; 
(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from 
any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant 
reduction in a margin of safety. The exempted financial protection 
regulation is unrelated to the operation of Palisades or site 
activities. Accordingly, there is no significant change in the types or 
significant increase in the amounts of any effluents that may be 
released offsite and no significant increase in individual or 
cumulative public or occupational radiation exposure. The exempted 
regulation is not associated with construction so there is no 
significant construction impact. The exempted regulation does not 
concern the source term (i.e., potential amount of radiation in an 
accident) nor any activities conducted at the site. Therefore, there is 
no significant increase in the potential for, or consequences of, a 
radiological accident. In addition, there would be no significant 
impacts to biota, water resources, historic properties, cultural 
resources, or socioeconomic conditions in the region resulting from 
issuance of the requested exemption. The requirement for onsite 
property damage insurance involves surety, insurance, and indemnity 
matters only.
    Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b) and 51.22(c)(25), no 
environmental impact statement or environmental assessment need be 
prepared in connection with the approval of this exemption request.

IV. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12(a), the exemption is authorized by law, will not present an undue 
risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common 
defense and security. Also, special circumstances are present as set 
forth in 10 CFR 50.12.
    Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Holtec Palisades and HDI an 
exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.54(w)(1) for Palisades. 
Palisades permanently ceased power operations on May 20, 2022. The 
exemption permits Palisades to lower the minimum required onsite 
insurance to $50 million 12 months after permanent cessation of power 
operations, which was May 20, 2023. Because this period had already 
elapsed, the exemption is effective upon issuance.

    Dated this 21st day of December, 2023.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Jane Marshall,

Director, Division of Decommissioning, Uranium, Recovery, and Waste 
Programs, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.

[NRC-2023-0218]


Regulatory Guide: Health Physics Surveys for Byproduct Material 
at NRC-Licensed Processing and Manufacturing Plants

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Regulatory guide: withdrawal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is withdrawing 
Regulatory Guide (RG) 8.21, ``Health Physics Surveys for Byproduct 
Material at NRC-Licensed Processing and Manufacturing Plants.'' This RG 
is being withdrawn because there is more up-to-date guidance in NUREG-
1556, ``Consolidated Guidance About Materials Licenses,'' making RG 
8.21 obsolete.

DATES: The effective date of the withdrawal of RG 8.21 is January 2, 
2024.

Regulatory Research, telephone: 301-415-2493; email: 
[email protected]. Both are staff of the Office of Nuclear 
Regulatory Research at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555-0001.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The NRC is withdrawing RG 8.21, ``Health 
Physics Surveys for Byproduct Material at NRC-Licensed Processing and 
Manufacturing Plants.'' The NRC staff issued RG 8.21 in 1979 to 
describe the methods and procedures considered acceptable by the NRC 
staff to comply with the survey requirements found in part 20 of title 
10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), ``Standards for 
Protection Against Radiation.'' Although 10 CFR part 20 was revised in 
1991 (May 21, 1991; 56 FR 23390), RG 8.21 was not updated.
    Since the staff had consolidated and followed the latest guidance 
pertinent to materials licensees found in NUREG-1556, ``Consolidated 
Guidance About Materials Licenses,'' RG 8.21 became outdated. 
Specifically, guidance for the advanced survey/measurement techniques 
and other more recent survey procedures are currently included in 
NUREG-1556, Volume 12, Revision 1 (ADAMS Accession No. ML18136A704). 
Issues identified during the periodic reviews of RG 8.21 in 2012 and 
2023 include: 1) the citations to the regulations described in RG 8.21 
were not consistent with those listed in the 1991 revision of 10 CFR 
20, 2) several of the references were outdated (e.g., some references 
were dated from the 1950's and no longer available to the public), and 
3) the latest advances since 1979 in survey/measurement techniques and 
equipment that have been effective were not included in RG 8.21. For 
these reasons and because NUREG-1556 provides current health physics 
survey guidance to NRC byproduct material licensees, the NRC determined 
that RG 8.21 is no longer needed and is being withdrawn.
    Withdrawal of an RG means that the guide no longer provides useful 
information or has been superseded by other guidance, technological 
innovations, congressional actions, or other events. The withdrawal of 
RG 8.21 does not alter any prior or existing NRC licensing approval or 
the acceptability of licensee commitments to RG 8.21. Although RG 8.21 
is withdrawn, current licensees may continue to use it, and withdrawal 
does not affect any existing licenses or agreements. However, RG 8.21 
should not be used in future requests or applications for NRC licensing 
actions.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-285; NRC-2022-0127]


Omaha Public Power District; Fort Calhoun Station, Unit 1; 
Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing a 
finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and accompanying environmental 
assessment (EA) regarding the NRC's consideration of a license 
amendment request by Omaha Public Power District (OPPD) to approve the 
License Termination Plan (LTP) for the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit 1 
(FCS), located in Washington County, Nebraska. If approved, the 
amendment would add a license condition to the FCS license reflecting 
the NRC's approval of its LTP and establishing criteria for determining 
when changes to the LTP require prior NRC approval. OPPD would use the 
LTP to meet the requirements for terminating the license and releasing 
the site for unrestricted use. Based on the EA, the NRC staff has 
concluded that there will be no significant impacts to environmental 
resources from the requested license amendment, and therefore, a FONSI 
is appropriate.

DATES: The EA and FONSI referenced in this document is available on 
January 2, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Introduction

    The NRC is considering issuance of a license amendment request to 
approve the LTP for the FCS, located in Washington County, Nebraska, as 
part of OPPD's part 50 of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations 
(10 CFR), ``Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization 
Facilities,'' Facility Operating License No. DPR-40. If granted, the 
license amendment would add a condition to FCS's license reflecting the 
NRC's approval of FCS's LTP and establishing criteria for determining 
when changes to the LTP require prior NRC approval. As required by 10 
CFR part 51, ``Environmental Protection Regulations for Domestic 
Licensing and Related Regulatory Functions,'' the NRC prepared an 
environmental assessment (EA). Based on the results of the EA, the NRC 
has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) 
for the license amendment request and is issuing a finding of no 
significant impact (FONSI).
    Construction of FCS began in 1968, and the NRC issued an operating 
license to the OPPD in 1973. The FCS began commercial operation in 
September 1973. The OPPD submitted the Certification of Permanent 
Cessation of Power Operations in August 2016 in accordance with 10 CFR 
50.82 (a)(1)(i) and shutdown on October 24, 2016. Pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(1)(ii), on November 13, 2016, the OPPD certified to the NRC 
that as of November 2016, all fuel had been removed from the FCS 
reactor vessel and placed into the FCS spent fuel pool.
    Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.82(a)(4)(i), the OPPD submitted its initial 
Post-Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report (PSDAR) on March 30, 
2017, and supplemented it by letter dated December 14, 2017. The PSDAR 
described OPPD's selection of the SAFSTOR method for decommissioning 
the FCS. The FCS reactor remained in SAFSTOR until December 16, 2019.

[[Page 106]]

    On December 16, 2019, as supplemented by letter dated July 16, 
2020, the OPPD submitted a revised PSDAR to the NRC to reflect schedule 
changes and select a new method for decommissioning the FCS pursuant to 
10 CFR 50.82(a)(7). The revised PSDAR described OPPD's selection of the 
DECON method for decommissioning the FCS.
    By letter dated May 18, 2020, the OPPD certified to the NRC that as 
of May 13, 2020, all spent fuel assemblies had been permanently 
transferred out of the FCS spent fuel pool and placed in storage within 
the independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI). The OPPD 
submitted the LTP on August 3, 2021, in accordance with 10 CFR 
50.82(a)(9).

II. Environmental Assessment

Description of the Proposed Action

    The proposed action is the review and subsequent approval, if 
appropriate, of a license amendment to OPPD to approve the LTP for the 
FCS. If approved, the amendment would add a license condition to the 
FCS license reflecting the NRC's approval of the LTP and establishing 
criteria for determining when changes to the LTP require prior NRC 
approval.
    The proposed action is described in the OPPD's 2021 LTP application 
and responses to requests for additional information dated June 15, 
2022, and February 27, 2023.

Purpose and Need for the Proposed Action

    The purpose of and need for the proposed action is to allow for 
completion of decommissioning of the FCS site by the OPPD, termination 
of the FCS operating license by the NRC, and subsequent release of the 
FCS site for unrestricted use. The NRC regulation at 10 CFR 50.82 sets 
forth the process for the licensee to decommission its nuclear power 
plant, including submission of the LTP. The NRC will approve the LTP, 
provided that the LTP meets the criteria in 10 CFR 50.82(a)(10).

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action

    The NRC staff considered the potential impacts of the proposed 
action on land use, historical and cultural resources; visual and 
scenic resources; meteorology, climatology, and air quality; noise; 
geology and soils; water resources; ecological resources; 
socioeconomics; public and occupation health; transportation and 
traffic; environmental justice; and waste management. The 
Decommissioning Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) (NUREG-
0586) generically addressed many of the potential environmental impacts 
of decommissioning at the FCS. During its review of the FCS LTP, the 
NRC concluded that the impacts for most resource areas--onsite land 
use; water resources; air quality; ecology, not including threatened 
and endangered species or outside the operational area; socioeconomics; 
historic and cultural resources within the operational area; 
aesthetics; noise; transportation; and nonradioactive waste 
management--were still bounded by the Decommissioning GEIS. Therefore, 
the NRC does not expect impacts associated with these issues beyond 
those discussed in the GEIS, which concluded that the impact level for 
these issues was SMALL.
    In the Decommissioning GEIS, the NRC staff concluded that it could 
not necessarily determine the environmental impacts of decommissioning 
generically for six environmental resource areas (offsite land use, 
threatened and endangered species, aquatic ecology beyond the 
operational area, terrestrial ecology beyond the operational area, 
environmental justice, and historic and cultural resources beyond the 
operational area). The Decommissioning GEIS determined that for these 
six resource areas a site-specific analysis would be required as was 
done in the FCS EA. In addition, topics not included in the 
Decommissioning GEIS that the NRC staff evaluated in the FCS EA include 
the affected environment, climate change, cumulative impacts, 
contamination of groundwater from decommissioning activities, and 
nonradioactive waste management.
    In the FCS EA, the NRC staff evaluated the potential environmental 
impacts on the six site-specific environmental resource areas as well 
as the five resource areas not evaluated in the Decommissioning GEIS 
and did not identify any significant impacts. For the proposed action 
there are no planned activities outside of the operational area, and 
the OPPD commits to using best management practices and obtaining all 
necessary licenses from Federal or State agencies to protect the 
surrounding lands. Therefore, the proposed action would result in no 
significant impacts and there would be no significant cumulative 
effects when added to the past, present, or reasonably foreseeable 
future actions at the FCS site.

Environmental Impacts of the Alternatives to the Proposed Action

    As an alternative to the proposed action, the NRC staff considered 
the ``no-action'' alternative. Under the no-action alternative, the NRC 
would not approve the LTP or the license amendment request because 
regulatory requirements have not been met. If the NRC was unable to 
approve the LTP because the regulatory requirements were not met, the 
OPPD would need to take additional actions to prepare an LTP that meets 
the requirements in 10 CFR 50.82(a)(10). Under this scenario, until the 
OPPD resubmits the LTP, activities at FCS would likely continue and the 
environmental impacts would neither increase nor decrease as a result 
of the additional time required for the LTP resubmission.

Agencies and Persons Consulted

    On August 18, 2023, the NRC staff provided a copy of the draft EA 
to the State of Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services for 
its review and comment. In a letter dated October 12, 2023, the State 
provided comments on the State's applicable regulations for air 
quality, stormwater, water quality, and waste management. The comments 
were incorporated into the EA, as applicable.
    The NRC completed consultation under section 106 of the National 
Historic Preservation Act by consulting with the Nebraska State 
Historic Preservation Office and 12 Federally recognized Indian Tribes 
in correspondence dated August 3, 2022. In addition, the NRC staff, 
consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and determined 
that the proposed action ``may affect, but not likely to adversely 
affect'' the Northern Long-eared Bat, Tricolored Bat, Piping Plover, 
Monarch Butterfly, and the Pallid Sturgeon, and would have ``no 
effect'' on critical habitat. The NRC staff provided its effect 
determinations to FWS on August 18, 2023, and FWS concurred with those 
findings on November 5, 2023, and provided no additional comments. 
Therefore, consultation has been completed under section 7 of the 
Endangered Species Act.

III. Finding of No Significant Impact

    Based on its review of the license amendment request, in accordance 
with the requirements of 10 CFR part 51, the NRC staff has determined 
that issuing the requested amendment, if appropriate, of a license 
termination to OPPD's DPR-40 license would not significantly affect the 
quality of human environment. No significant radiological or non-
radiological impacts are

[[Page 107]]

expected from the proposed action. Therefore, the NRC staff has 
determined that pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, ``Determinations based on 
environmental assessment,'' preparation of an EIS is not required for 
the proposed action, and pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, ``Finding of no 
significant impact,'' a FONSI is appropriate. In accordance with 10 CFR 
51.32(a)(4), this FONSI incorporates the EA set forth in this notice by 
reference.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[Docket No. 50-255; NRC-2023-0200]


Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC, and Holtec Palisades, 
LLC; Palisades Nuclear Plant; Exemption

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: Notice; issuance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued an 
exemption in response to a request from Holtec Decommissioning 
International, LLC (HDI), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Holtec 
International, that would allow HDI and Holtec Palisades, LLC, 
regarding certain emergency planning (EP) requirements. The exemption 
eliminates the requirements to maintain an offsite radiological 
emergency preparedness plan and reduce the scope of onsite EP 
activities at the Palisades Nuclear Plant, based on the reduced risks 
of accidents that could result in an offsite radiological release at a 
decommissioning nuclear power reactor.

DATES: The exemption was issued on December 22, 2023.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Docket No. 50-255

Holtec Decommissioning International, LLC, and Holtec Palisades, LLC; 
Palisades Nuclear Plant, Exemption

I. Background

    By letter dated October 19, 2017 (Agencywide Documents Access and 
Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML17292A032), Entergy Nuclear 
Operations, Inc. (ENOI) certified to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC, or Commission) that it planned to permanently cease 
power operations at the Palisades Nuclear Plant (Palisades) no later 
than May 31, 2022. On May 20, 2022, ENOI permanently ceased power 
operations at Palisades, and by letter dated June 13, 2022 
(ML22164A067), ENOI certified to the NRC that the fuel was permanently 
removed from the Palisades reactor vessel and placed in the spent fuel 
pool (SFP) on June 10, 2022.
    By application dated December 23, 2020 (ML20358A075), as 
supplemented

[[Page 102]]

by information provided in letters from Holtec Decommissioning 
International, LLC (HDI, the licensee) dated December 23, 2020, and 
October 29, 2021 (ML20358A232, ML20358A239, and ML21302A064), ENOI, 
Entergy Nuclear Palisades, LLC, Holtec International, and HDI submitted 
an ``Application for Order Consenting to Transfers of Control of 
Licenses and Approving Conforming License Amendments'' requesting 
transfer of the Palisades license to HDI. By letter dated December 13, 
2021 (ML21292A145), the NRC issued an order consenting to the license 
transfer and draft conforming administrative license amendments. The 
license transfer was executed on June 28, 2022 (ML22173A173), 
coinciding with the transition of Palisades from an operational to a 
decommissioning status.
    Based on the docketing of the certifications for permanent 
cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor 
vessel, as specified in section 50.82(a)(2) of title 10 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations (10 CFR), the 10 CFR part 50 renewed facility 
operating license for Palisades no longer authorizes operation of the 
reactor or emplacement or retention of fuel in the reactor vessel. The 
facility is still authorized to possess and store irradiated (i.e., 
spent) nuclear fuel. Palisades spent fuel is currently stored in the 
SFP and in dry cask storage at the independent spent fuel storage 
installation (ISFSI).
    Many of the accident scenarios postulated in the updated safety 
analysis reports (USARs) for operating nuclear power reactors involve 
failures or malfunctions of systems, which could affect the fuel in the 
reactor core and, in the most severe postulated accidents, would 
involve the release of some fission products. With the permanent 
cessation of power operations at Palisades and the permanent removal of 
fuel from the reactor vessel, many accidents are no longer possible. 
The reactor, reactor coolant system, and supporting systems are no 
longer in operation and have no function related to the storage of the 
spent fuel. Therefore, the emergency planning (EP) provisions for 
postulated accidents involving failure or malfunction of the reactor, 
reactor coolant system, or supporting systems are no longer applicable.
    The EP requirements of 10 CFR 50.47, ``Emergency plans,'' and 
appendix E, ``Emergency Planning and Preparedness for Production and 
Utilization Facilities,'' to 10 CFR part 50 continue to apply to 
nuclear power reactors that have provided certification that they have 
permanently ceased operations and have permanently removed all fuel 
from the reactor vessel. There are no explicit regulatory provisions 
distinguishing EP requirements for a power reactor that is permanently 
shut down and defueled from those for a reactor that is authorized to 
operate. To reduce or eliminate EP requirements that are no longer 
necessary due to the decommissioning status of the facility, the 
licensee must obtain exemptions from those EP regulations. Only then 
can HDI modify the Palisades emergency plan to reflect the reduced risk 
associated with the permanently shutdown and defueled condition of 
Palisades.

II. Request/Action

    By letter dated July 11, 2022 (ML22192A134), HDI requested 
exemptions from specific portions of the EP requirements of 10 CFR 
50.47 and appendix E to 10 CFR part 50 for Palisades. More 
specifically, HDI requested exemptions from certain planning standards 
in 10 CFR 50.47(b) regarding onsite and offsite radiological emergency 
preparedness plans for nuclear power reactors; from certain 
requirements in 10 CFR 50.47(c)(2) for establishment of plume exposure 
pathway and ingestion pathway emergency planning zones (EPZs) for 
nuclear power reactors; and from certain requirements in 10 CFR part 
50, appendix E, section IV, ``Content of Emergency Plans.''
    The exemptions requested by HDI would eliminate the requirements to 
maintain formal offsite radiological emergency plans, reviewed by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the requirements of 44 
CFR, ``Emergency Management and Assistance,'' Part 350, ``Review and 
Approval of State and Local Radiological Emergency Plans and 
Preparedness,'' and would reduce the scope of the onsite EP activities 
at Palisades. HDI stated that application of all the standards and 
requirements in 10 CFR 50.47(b), 10 CFR 50.47(c), and 10 CFR part 50, 
appendix E is not needed for adequate emergency response capability, 
based on the substantially lower onsite and offsite radiological 
consequences of accidents still possible at the permanently shutdown 
and defueled facility as compared to an operating facility.
    If offsite protective actions were needed for a highly unlikely 
beyond design-basis accidents (DBAs) that could challenge the safe 
storage of spent fuel at Palisades, provisions exist for offsite 
agencies to take protective actions using a comprehensive emergency 
management plan (CEMP) under the National Preparedness System to 
protect the health and safety of the public. A CEMP in this context, 
also referred to as an emergency operations plan, is addressed in 
FEMA's Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101, ``Developing and 
Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans,'' which is publicly available 
at https://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/divisions/npd/CPG_101_V2.pdf. 
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101 is the foundation for State, 
territorial, Tribal, and local EP in the United States. It promotes a 
common understanding of the fundamentals of risk-informed planning and 
decision-making and helps planners at all levels of government in their 
efforts to develop and maintain viable, all-hazards, all-threats 
emergency plans. An emergency operations plan is flexible enough for 
use in all emergencies. It describes how people and property will be 
protected; details who is responsible for carrying out specific 
actions; identifies the personnel, equipment, facilities, supplies and 
other resources available; and outlines how all actions will be 
coordinated. A CEMP is often referred to as a synonym for ``all-hazards 
planning.''

III. Discussion

    In accordance with 10 CFR 50.12, ``Specific exemptions,'' the 
Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its 
own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 
50 when: (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present an 
undue risk to public health or safety, and are consistent with the 
common defense and security; and (2) any of the special circumstances 
listed in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2) are present. These special circumstances 
include, among other things, that the application of the regulation in 
the particular circumstances would not serve the underlying purpose of 
the rule or is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the 
rule.
    As noted previously, the EP regulations contained in 10 CFR 
50.47(b) and appendix E to 10 CFR part 50 apply to both operating and 
shutdown power reactors. The NRC has consistently acknowledged that the 
risk of an offsite radiological release at a power reactor that has 
permanently ceased operations and permanently removed fuel from the 
reactor vessel is significantly lower, and the types of possible 
accidents are significantly fewer, than at an operating power reactor. 
However, current EP regulations do not recognize that once a power

[[Page 103]]

reactor permanently ceases operation, the risk of a large radiological 
release from a credible emergency accident scenario is reduced. Due to 
the permanently defueled status of the reactor, no new spent fuel will 
be added to the Palisades SFP and the radionuclides in the current 
spent fuel will continue to decay as the spent fuel ages. The spent 
fuel will produce less heat due to radioactive decay, increasing the 
available time to mitigate a loss of water inventory from the SFP. The 
NRC's NUREG/CR-6451, ``A Safety and Regulatory Assessment of Generic 
BWR [Boiling Water Reactor] and PWR [Pressurized Water Reactor] 
Permanently Shutdown Nuclear Power Plants,'' dated August 1997 
(ML082260098), and the NRC's NUREG-1738, ``Technical Study of Spent 
Fuel Pool Accident Risk at Decommissioning Nuclear Power Plants,'' 
dated February 2001 (ML010430066), confirmed that for permanently 
shutdown and defueled power reactors that are bounded by the 
assumptions and conditions in the report, the risk of offsite 
radiological release is significantly less than for an operating 
nuclear power reactor.
    In the past, EP exemptions similar to those requested by HDI, have 
been granted to licensees of permanently shutdown and defueled power 
reactors. However, the exemptions did not relieve the licensees of all 
EP requirements. Rather, the exemptions allowed the licensees to modify 
their emergency plans commensurate with the credible site-specific 
risks that were consistent with a permanently shutdown and defueled 
status. Specifically, the NRC's approval of these prior exemptions from 
certain EP requirements was based on the licensee's demonstration that: 
(1) the radiological consequences of DBAs would not exceed the limits 
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Protective Action 
Guidelines (PAGs) at the exclusion area boundary, and (2) in the highly 
unlikely event of a beyond DBA resulting in a loss of all modes of 
cooling for the spent fuel stored in the SFP, there is sufficient time 
to initiate appropriate mitigating actions, and if needed, for offsite 
authorities to implement offsite protective actions using a CEMP 
approach to protect the health and safety of the public. In prior 
exemptions, sufficient time was demonstrated if the time exceeded 10 
hours from the loss of coolant until the fuel temperature would be 
expected to reach 900 degrees Celsius ([deg]C), assuming no air 
cooling. In this exemption request, the licensee provided an analysis 
demonstrating that after the spent fuel has decayed for 12 months, for 
beyond-design-basis events where the SFP is drained and air cooling is 
not possible, at least 10 hours would be available from the time spent 
fuel cooling is lost until the hottest fuel assembly reaches a 
temperature of 900 [deg]C. This 10-hour minimum threshold provides 
sufficient time for the licensee to take mitigative actions, or if 
government officials deem warranted, for offsite protective actions to 
be initiated using a CEMP or ``all-hazards'' approach.
    The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's justification for the 
requested exemptions against the criteria in 10 CFR 50.12(a) and 
determined, as described below, that the criteria in 10 CFR 50.12(a) 
are met, and that the exemptions should be granted. An assessment of 
the HDI EP exemptions is described in SECY-23-0043, ``Request by Holtec 
Decommissioning International, LLC for Exemptions from Certain 
Emergency Planning Requirements for Palisades Nuclear Plant,'' dated 
May 30, 2023 (ML23054A179). The Commission approved the NRC staff's 
recommendation to grant the exemptions in the staff requirements 
memorandum to SECY-23-0043, dated December 7, 2023 (ML23341A181). The 
exemptions are conditioned to make it clear that the exemptions will 
terminate if the status of the Palisades reactor changes such that the 
certifications of permanent cessation of operations and permanent 
removal of fuel from the reactor vessel are no longer applicable. 
Descriptions of the specific exemptions requested by HDI and the NRC 
staff's basis for granting each exemption are provided in SECY-23-0043. 
The staff's detailed review and technical basis for the approval of the 
specific EP exemptions, requested by HDI, are provided in the NRC 
staff's safety evaluation dated December 22, 2023 (ML23263A977).

A. The Exemption Is Authorized by Law

    The licensee has proposed exemptions from certain EP requirements 
in 10 CFR 50.47(b), 10 CFR 50.47(c)(2), and 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, 
section IV, which would allow HDI to revise the Palisades Emergency 
Plan to reflect the submittal of the certification of the permanently 
shutdown and defueled condition of the facility. As stated above, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by 
any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from 
the requirements of 10 CFR part 50. The NRC staff has determined that 
granting of the licensee's proposed exemptions will not result in a 
violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or the NRC's 
regulations. Therefore, the exemptions are authorized by law.

B. The Exemption Presents no Undue Risk to Public Health and Safety

    As stated previously, HDI provided analyses that show the 
radiological consequences of DBA will not exceed the limits of the EPA 
PAGs at the exclusion area boundary. Therefore, formal offsite 
radiological emergency plans required under 10 CFR part 50 are no 
longer needed for protection of the public beyond the exclusion area 
boundary, based on the radiological consequences of DBAs still possible 
at Palisades.
    Although highly unlikely, there is one postulated beyond DBA that 
might result in significant offsite radiological releases. However, 
NUREG-1738 confirms that the risk of beyond DBAs is greatly reduced at 
permanently shutdown and defueled reactors. The NRC staff's analyses in 
NUREG-1738 concludes that the event sequences important to risk at 
permanently shutdown and defueled power reactors are limited to large 
earthquakes and cask drop events. For EP assessments, this is an 
important difference relative to the operating power reactors, where 
typically a large number of different sequences make significant 
contributions to risk. As described in NUREG-1738, relaxation of 
offsite EP requirements in 10 CFR part 50 a few months after shutdown 
resulted in only a small change in risk. The report further concludes 
that the change in risk due to relaxation of offsite EP requirements is 
small because the overall risk is low, and because even under current 
EP requirements for operating power reactors, EP was judged to have 
marginal impact on evacuation effectiveness in the severe earthquake 
event that dominates SFP risk. All other sequences including cask drops 
(for which offsite radiological emergency plans are expected to be more 
effective) are too low in likelihood to have a significant impact on 
risk. Therefore, granting exemptions to eliminate the requirements of 
10 CFR part 50 to maintain offsite radiological emergency preparedness 
plans and to reduce the scope of onsite EP activities will not present 
an undue risk to the public health and safety.

[[Page 104]]

C. The Exemption Is Consistent With the Common Defense and Security

    The requested exemptions by HDI only involve EP requirements under 
10 CFR part 50 and will allow HDI to revise the Palisades Emergency 
Plan to reflect the permanently shutdown and defueled condition of the 
facility. Physical security measures at Palisades are not affected by 
the requested EP exemptions. The discontinuation of formal offsite 
radiological emergency preparedness plans and the reduction in scope of 
the onsite EP activities at Palisades will not adversely affect the 
licensee's ability to physically secure the site or protect special 
nuclear material. Therefore, the proposed exemptions are consistent 
with common defense and security.

D. Special Circumstances

    Special circumstances, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), 
are present whenever application of the regulation in the particular 
circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the 
rule. The underlying purpose of 10 CFR 50.47(b), 10 CFR 50.47(c)(2), 
and 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, section IV, is to provide reasonable 
assurance that adequate protective measures can and will be taken in 
the event of a radiological emergency, to establish plume exposure and 
ingestion pathway emergency planning zones for nuclear power plants, 
and to ensure that licensees maintain effective offsite and onsite 
radiological emergency preparedness plans. The standards and 
requirements in these regulations were developed by considering the 
risks associated with operation of a nuclear power reactor at its 
licensed full-power level. These risks include the potential for a 
reactor accident with offsite radiological dose consequences.
    As discussed previously in Section III, because Palisades is 
permanently shut down and defueled, there is no longer a risk of 
offsite radiological release from a DBA and the risk of a significant 
offsite radiological release from a beyond DBA is greatly reduced when 
compared to the risk at an operating power reactor. The NRC staff has 
confirmed the reduced risks at Palisades by comparing the generic risk 
assumptions in the analyses in NUREG-1738 to site-specific conditions 
at Palisades and determined that the risk values in NUREG-1738 bound 
the risks presented for Palisades. As indicated by the results of the 
research conducted for NUREG-1738, and more recently for NUREG-2161, 
``Consequence Study of a Beyond-Design-Basis Earthquake Affecting the 
Spent Fuel Pool for a U.S. Mark I Boiling Water Reactor,'' dated 
September 2014 (ML14255A365), while other consequences can be 
extensive, accidents from SFPs with significant decay time have little 
potential to cause offsite early fatalities, even if the formal offsite 
radiological EP requirements were relaxed. HDI's analysis of a beyond 
DBA involving a complete loss of SFP water inventory, based on an 
adiabatic heatup analysis of the limiting fuel assembly for decay heat, 
shows that 12 months after permanent cessation of power operations at 
Palisades, the time for the limiting fuel assembly to reach 900 [deg]C 
is at least 10 hours after the assemblies have been uncovered assuming 
a loss of all cooling means.
    The NRC staff has verified the licensee's analyses and its 
calculations. The analyses provide reasonable assurance that in 
granting the requested exemptions to HDI, there is no DBA that will 
result in an offsite radiological release exceeding the EPA PAGs at the 
exclusion area boundary. In the highly unlikely event of a beyond DBA 
affecting the SFP that results in a complete loss of heat removal via 
all modes of heat transfer, there will be a minimum of 10 hours 
available before an offsite release might occur and, therefore, at 
least 10 hours to initiate appropriate mitigating actions to restore a 
means of heat removal to the spent fuel. If a radiological release were 
projected to occur under this highly unlikely scenario, a minimum of 10 
hours is considered sufficient time for offsite authorities to 
implement protective actions using a CEMP approach to protect the 
health and safety of the public.
    Exemptions from the offsite EP requirements in 10 CFR part 50 have 
previously been approved by the NRC when the site-specific analyses 
show that at least 10 hours is available following a loss of SFP 
coolant inventory with no air cooling (or other methods of removing 
decay heat) until cladding of the hottest fuel assembly reaches the 
rapid oxidation temperature. The NRC staff concluded in its previously 
granted exemptions, as it does with the licensee's requested EP 
exemptions, that if a minimum of 10 hours is available to initiate 
mitigative actions consistent with plant conditions or, if needed, for 
offsite authorities to implement protective actions using a CEMP 
approach, then formal offsite radiological emergency preparedness 
plans, required under 10 CFR part 50, are not necessary at permanently 
shutdown and defueled facilities.
    Additionally, in its letter to the NRC dated July 11, 2022, HDI 
described the SFP makeup strategies that could be used in the event of 
a catastrophic loss of SFP inventory. The multiple strategies for 
providing makeup water to the SFP include: using various existing plant 
systems for inventory makeup and an internal strategy that relies on 
the portable FLEX pump manifold, and having available two installed 
diesel-driven fire pumps and one motor-driven fire pump that can 
provide 1,500 gallons per minute makeup water from the facility intake 
via hard pipe or hose stations. In addition, HDI states that two onsite 
FLEX pumper units with a capacity of 1,000 gallons per minute each can 
provide makeup water from the facility intake or from Lake Michigan 
directly. Further, Palisades procedures specify that the installation 
of the SFP spray monitor nozzles and direct fill should be given 
priority over the hard pipe fill connection due to expected SFP area 
high radiation levels if the SFP water level cannot be maintained. 
These strategies will continue to be required as License Condition 6.b 
of Renewed Facility License No. DPR-20 for Palisades. Considering the 
very low probability of beyond DBAs affecting the SFP, these diverse 
strategies provide multiple methods to obtain additional makeup or 
spray to the SFP before the onset of any postulated offsite 
radiological release.
    For all of the reasons stated above, the NRC staff finds that the 
licensee's requested exemptions meet the underlying purpose of all of 
the standards in 10 CFR 50.47(b), as well as the requirements in 10 CFR 
50.47(c)(2) and 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, and satisfy the special 
circumstances provision in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) in view of the 
greatly reduced risk of offsite radiological consequences associated 
with the permanently shutdown and defueled state of the Palisades 
facility 12 months after the facility permanently ceases operation.
    The NRC staff further concludes that the exemptions granted by this 
action will maintain an acceptable level of emergency preparedness at 
Palisades and provide reasonable assurance that adequate offsite 
protective measures, if needed, can and will be taken by State and 
local government agencies using a CEMP approach, in the highly unlikely 
event of a radiological emergency at Palisades. Since the underlying 
purposes of the rules, as exempted, would continue to be achieved, even 
with the elimination of the requirements under 10 CFR part 50 to 
maintain formal offsite radiological emergency plans and the reduction 
in the scope of the onsite EP activities at Palisades, the special

[[Page 105]]

circumstances required by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) exist.

E. Environmental Considerations

    In accordance with 10 CFR 51.31(a), the Commission has determined 
that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant effect 
on the quality of the human environment as discussed in the NRC staff's 
Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact published 
in the Federal Register (FR) on December 21, 2023 (88 FR 88664).

IV. Conclusions

    Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
50.12, the licensee's request for exemptions from certain EP 
requirements in 10 CFR 50.47(b), 10 CFR 50.47(c)(2), and 10 CFR part 
50, appendix E, section IV, and as summarized in Enclosure 2 to SECY-
23-0043, are authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the 
public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense 
and security. Also, special circumstances are present. Therefore, the 
Commission hereby grants HDI exemptions from certain EP requirements in 
10 CFR 50.47(b), 10 CFR 50.47(c)(2), and 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, 
section IV, as discussed and evaluated in detail in the NRC staff's 
safety evaluation dated December 22, 2023. The exemptions are effective 
12 months after permanent cessation of power operations, which was May 
20, 2023. Because this period had already elapsed, the exemption is 
effective upon issuance. These exemptions will terminate if the status 
of the Palisades reactor changes such that the certifications of 
permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from 
the reactor vessel are no longer applicable.

    Dated: this 22nd day of December 2023.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

[NRC-2023-0207]


Applications for Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
Involving Proposed No Significant Hazards Considerations and Containing 
Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information and Order Imposing 
Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards 
Information

AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

ACTION: License amendment request; notice of opportunity to comment, 
request a hearing, and petition for leave to intervene; order imposing 
procedures.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is 
considering approval of two amendment requests. The amendment requests 
are for Millstone Power Station, Unit 3 and Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, 
Units 1 and 2. For each amendment request, the NRC proposes to 
determine that it involves no significant hazards consideration (NSHC). 
Because each amendment request contains sensitive unclassified non-
safeguards information (SUNSI), an order imposes procedures to obtain 
access to SUNSI for contention preparation by persons who file a 
hearing request or petition for leave to intervene.

DATES: Comments must be filed by February 1, 2024. A request for a 
hearing or petitions for leave to intervene must be filed by March 4, 
2024. Any potential party as defined in section 2.4 of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) who believes access to SUNSI is 
necessary to respond to this notice must request document access by 
January 12, 2024.

II. Background

    Pursuant to section 189a.(1)-(2) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (the Act), the NRC is publishing this notice. The Act 
requires the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued or 
proposed to be issued and grants the Commission the authority to issue 
and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating license or 
combined license, as applicable, upon a determination by the Commission 
that such amendment involves NSHC, notwithstanding the pendency before 
the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.
    This notice includes notices of amendments containing SUNSI.

[[Page 109]]

III. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility 
Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration 
Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing

    The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following 
amendment requests involve NSHC. Under the Commission's regulations in 
10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance 
with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significant 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this 
proposed determination for each amendment request is shown as follows.
    The Commission is seeking public comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination.
    Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these license amendments before expiration 
of the 60-day period provided that its final determination is that the 
amendments involve no significant hazards consideration. In addition, 
the Commission may issue any of these amendments prior to the 
expiration of the 30-day comment period if circumstances change during 
the 30-day comment period such that failure to act in a timely way 
would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility. If 
the Commission takes action on any of these amendments prior to the 
expiration of either the comment period or the notice period, it will 
publish a notice of issuance in the Federal Register. If the Commission 
makes a final no significant hazards consideration determination for 
any of these amendments, any hearing on those amendments will take 
place after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this 
action will occur very infrequently.

A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing and Petition for Leave To Intervene

    Within 60 days after the date of publication of this notice, any 
person (petitioner) whose interest may be affected by any of these 
actions may file a request for a hearing and petition for leave to 
intervene (petition) with respect to that action. Petitions shall be 
filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Agency Rules of Practice 
and Procedure'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a 
current copy of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the Commission or 
a presiding officer will rule on the petition and, if appropriate, a 
notice of a hearing will be issued.
    Petitions must be filed no later than 60 days from the date of 
publication of this notice in accordance with the filing instructions 
in the ``Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)'' section of this document. 
Petitions and motions for leave to file new or amended contentions that 
are filed after the deadline will not be entertained absent a 
determination by the presiding officer that the filing demonstrates 
good cause by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 2.309(c)(1)(i) 
through (iii).
    If a hearing is requested, and the Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which will serve to establish when 
the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment 
request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission 
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue an appropriate order or rule 
under 10 CFR part 2.
    A State, local governmental body, Federally recognized Indian 
Tribe, or designated agency thereof, may submit a petition to the 
Commission to participate as a party under 10 CFR 2.309(h) no later 
than 60 days from the date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local governmental body, Federally recognized 
Indian Tribe, or agency thereof may participate as a non-party under 10 
CFR 2.315(c).
    For information about filing a petition and about participation by 
a person not a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS Accession No. 
ML20340A053 (https://adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/main.jsp?AccessionNumber=ML20340A053) and on the NRC's public website 
at https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/regulatory/adjudicatory/hearing.html#participate.

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing)

    All documents filed in NRC adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or designated agency thereof that 
requests to participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must be filed in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies on electronic storage media, 
unless an exemption permitting an alternative filing method, as further 
discussed, is granted. Detailed guidance on electronic submissions is 
located in the ``Guidance for Electronic Submissions to the NRC'' 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056) and on the NRC's public website at 
https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html.
    To comply with the procedural requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the participant should contact the 
Office of the Secretary by email at [email protected], or by 
telephone at 301-415-1677, to (1) request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate, which allows the participant (or its counsel or 
representative) to digitally sign submissions and access the E-Filing 
system for any proceeding in which it is participating; and (2) advise 
the Secretary that the participant will be submitting a petition or 
other adjudicatory document (even in instances in which the 
participant, or its counsel or representative, already holds an NRC-
issued digital ID certificate). Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an electronic docket.
    Information about applying for a digital ID certificate is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is 
obtained and a docket created, the participant must submit adjudicatory 
documents in Portable Document Format. Guidance on submissions is 
available on the NRC's public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the 
time the document is submitted through the NRC's E-Filing system. To be 
timely, an electronic filing must be submitted to the E-Filing system 
no later than 11:59 p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt of a 
transmission, the E-Filing system

[[Page 110]]

time-stamps the document and sends the submitter an email confirming 
receipt of the document. The E-Filing system also distributes an email 
that provides access to the document to the NRC's Office of the General 
Counsel and any others who have advised the Office of the Secretary 
that they wish to participate in the proceeding, so that the filer need 
not serve the document on those participants separately. Therefore, 
applicants and other participants (or their counsel or representative) 
must apply for and receive a digital ID certificate before adjudicatory 
documents are filed to obtain access to the documents via the E-Filing 
system.
    A person filing electronically using the NRC's adjudicatory E-
Filing system may seek assistance by contacting the NRC's Electronic 
Filing Help Desk through the ``Contact Us'' link located on the NRC's 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals.html, by 
email to [email protected], or by a toll-free call at 1-866-672-
7640. The NRC Electronic Filing Help Desk is available between 9 a.m. 
and 6 p.m., ET, Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.
    Participants who believe that they have good cause for not 
submitting documents electronically must file an exemption request, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper filing 
stating why there is good cause for not filing electronically and 
requesting authorization to continue to submit documents in paper 
format. Such filings must be submitted in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302(b)-(d). Participants filing adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still 
meet the electronic formatting requirement in 10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), 
unless the participant also seeks and is granted an exemption from 10 
CFR 2.302(g)(1).
    Documents submitted in adjudicatory proceedings will appear in the 
NRC's electronic hearing docket, which is publicly available at https://adams.nrc.gov/ehd, unless excluded pursuant to an order of the 
presiding officer. If you do not have an NRC-issued digital ID 
certificate as previously described, click ``cancel'' when the link 
requests certificates and you will be automatically directed to the 
NRC's electronic hearing dockets where you will be able to access any 
publicly available documents in a particular hearing docket. 
Participants are requested not to include personal privacy information 
such as social security numbers, home addresses, or personal phone 
numbers in their filings unless an NRC regulation or other law requires 
submission of such information. With respect to copyrighted works, 
except for limited excerpts that serve the purpose of the adjudicatory 
filings and would constitute a Fair Use application, participants 
should not include copyrighted materials in their submission.
    The following table provides the plant names, docket numbers, date 
of application, ADAMS accession number, and location in the application 
of the licensee's proposed NSHC determination. For further details with 
respect to these license amendment applications, see the applications 
for amendment, publicly available portions of which are available for 
public inspection in ADAMS. For additional direction on accessing 
information related to this document, see the ``Obtaining Information 
and Submitting Comments'' section of this document.

Order Imposing Procedures for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-
Safeguards Information for Contention Preparation

Dominion Energy Nuclear Connecticut, Inc.; Millstone Power Station, 
Unit 3; New London County, CT;

Tennessee Valley Authority; Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; 
Rhea County, TN

    A. This Order contains instructions regarding how potential parties 
to this proceeding may request access to documents containing Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information (SUNSI).
    B. Within 10 days after publication of this notice of hearing or 
opportunity for hearing, any potential party who believes access to 
SUNSI is necessary to respond to this notice may request access to 
SUNSI. A ``potential party'' is any person who intends to participate 
as a party by demonstrating standing and filing an admissible 
contention under 10 CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI submitted 
later than 10 days after publication of this notice will not be 
considered absent a showing of good cause for the late filing, 
addressing why the request could not have been filed earlier.
    C. The requestor shall submit a letter requesting permission to 
access SUNSI to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, Attention: Rulemakings and 
Adjudications Staff, and provide a copy to the Deputy General Counsel 
for Licensing, Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the General 
Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001. 
The expedited delivery or courier mail address for both offices is: 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, 
Maryland 20852. The email addresses for the Office of the Secretary and 
the Office of the General Counsel are [email protected] and 
[email protected], respectively.\1\ The request must 
include the following information:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ While a request for hearing or petition to intervene in this 
proceeding must comply with the filing requirements of the NRC's 
``E-Filing Rule,'' the initial request to access SUNSI under these 
procedures should be submitted as described in this paragraph.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A description of the licensing action with a citation to this 
Federal Register notice;
    (2) The name and address of the potential party and a description 
of the potential party's particularized interest that could be harmed 
by the action identified in C.(1); and
    (3) The identity of the individual or entity requesting access to 
SUNSI and the requestor's basis for the need for the information in 
order to meaningfully participate in this adjudicatory proceeding. In 
particular, the request must explain why publicly available versions of 
the information requested would not be sufficient to provide the basis 
and specificity for a proffered contention.
    D. Based on an evaluation of the information submitted under 
paragraph C, the NRC staff will determine within 10 days of receipt of 
the request whether:
    (1) There is a reasonable basis to believe the petitioner is likely 
to establish standing to participate in this NRC proceeding; and
    (2) The requestor has established a legitimate need for access to 
SUNSI.
    E. If the NRC staff determines that the requestor satisfies both 
D.(1) and D.(2), the NRC staff will notify the requestor in writing 
that access to SUNSI has been granted. The written notification will 
contain instructions on how the requestor may obtain copies of the 
requested documents, and any other conditions that may apply to access 
to those documents. These conditions may include, but are not limited 
to, the signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit, or 
Protective Order \2\ setting forth terms and conditions to prevent the 
unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of SUNSI by each individual who 
will be granted access to SUNSI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Any motion for Protective Order or draft Non-Disclosure 
Affidavit or Agreement for SUNSI must be filed with the presiding 
officer or the Chief Administrative Judge if the presiding officer 
has not yet been designated, within 30 days of the deadline for the 
receipt of the written access request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    F. Filing of Contentions. Any contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received as a result of the request made 
for SUNSI must be filed by the requestor no later than 25 days after 
receipt of (or access to) that information. However, if more than 25 
days remain between the petitioner's receipt of (or access to) the 
information and the deadline for filing all other contentions (as 
established in the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing), the 
petitioner may file its SUNSI contentions by that later deadline.
    G. Review of Denials of Access.
    (1) If the request for access to SUNSI is denied by the NRC staff 
after a determination on standing and requisite need, the NRC staff 
shall immediately notify the requestor in writing, briefly stating the 
reason or reasons for the denial.
    (2) The requestor may challenge the NRC staff's adverse 
determination by filing a challenge within 5 days of receipt of that 
determination with: (a) the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; (b) if no presiding officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has been 
designated to rule on information access issues, with that officer.
    (3) Further appeals of decisions under this paragraph must be made 
pursuant to 10 CFR 2.311.
    H. Review of Grants of Access. A party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination granting access to SUNSI whose 
release would harm that party's interest independent of the proceeding. 
Such a challenge must be filed within 5 days of the notification by the 
NRC staff of its grant of access and must be filed with: (a) the 
presiding officer designated in this proceeding; (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another administrative judge, or an 
Administrative Law Judge with jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 2.318(a); 
or (c) if another officer has been designated to rule on information 
access issues, with that officer.
    If challenges to the NRC staff determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. The availability of interlocutory 
review by the Commission of orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether

[[Page 112]]

granting or denying access) is governed by 10 CFR 2.311.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Requestors should note that the filing requirements of the 
NRC's E-Filing Rule (72 FR 49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 
FR 46562; August 3, 2012, 78 FR 34247, June 7, 2013) apply to 
appeals of NRC staff determinations (because they must be served on 
a presiding officer or the Commission, as applicable), but not to 
the initial SUNSI request submitted to the NRC staff under these 
procedures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I. The Commission expects that the NRC staff and presiding officers 
(and any other reviewing officers) will consider and resolve requests 
for access to SUNSI, and motions for protective orders, in a timely 
fashion in order to minimize any unnecessary delays in identifying 
those petitioners who have standing and who have propounded contentions 
meeting the specificity and basis requirements in 10 CFR part 2. The 
attachment to this Order summarizes the general target schedule for 
processing and resolving requests under these procedures.
    It is so ordered.

    Dated: December 22, 2023.

    For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Russell E. Chazell,
Acting Secretary of the Commission.

   Attachment 1--General Target Schedule for Processing and Resolving
Requests for Access to Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards Information
                           in This Proceeding
------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Day                             Event/activity
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0........................  Publication of Federal Register notice of
                            hearing or opportunity for hearing,
                            including order with instructions for access
                            requests.
10.......................  Deadline for submitting requests for access
                            to Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards
                            Information (SUNSI) with information:
                            supporting the standing of a potential party
                            identified by name and address; describing
                            the need for the information in order for
                            the potential party to participate
                            meaningfully in an adjudicatory proceeding.
60.......................  Deadline for submitting petition for
                            intervention containing: (i) demonstration
                            of standing; and (ii) all contentions whose
                            formulation does not require access to SUNSI
                            (+25 Answers to petition for intervention;
                            +7 petitioner/requestor reply).
20.......................  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
                            staff informs the requestor of the staff's
                            determination whether the request for access
                            provides a reasonable basis to believe
                            standing can be established and shows need
                            for SUNSI. (NRC staff also informs any party
                            to the proceeding whose interest independent
                            of the proceeding would be harmed by the
                            release of the information.) If NRC staff
                            makes the finding of need for SUNSI and
                            likelihood of standing, NRC staff begins
                            document processing (preparation of
                            redactions or review of redacted documents).
25.......................  If NRC staff finds no ``need'' or no
                            likelihood of standing, the deadline for
                            petitioner/requestor to file a motion
                            seeking a ruling to reverse the NRC staff's
                            denial of access; NRC staff files copy of
                            access determination with the presiding
                            officer (or Chief Administrative Judge or
                            other designated officer, as appropriate).
                            If NRC staff finds ``need'' for SUNSI, the
                            deadline for any party to the proceeding
                            whose interest independent of the proceeding
                            would be harmed by the release of the
                            information to file a motion seeking a
                            ruling to reverse the NRC staff's grant of
                            access.

                            need for SUNSI, deadline for NRC staff to
                            complete information processing and file
                            motion for Protective Order and draft Non-
                            Disclosure Agreement or Affidavit. Deadline
                            for applicant/licensee to file Non-

                            officer or other designated officer decision

                            for providing access and submission of
                            contentions) or decision reversing a final
