Allows automated equipment to perform leak test of the MPC materials and welds in the fabrication shop. 4. Changes the hydrostatic pressure test of the MPC acceptance criteria to be examination for leakage only and removes post hydrostatic test liquid penetrant and magnetic particle examination. 5. Includes the ability to use computational fluid dynamics analysis to evaluate site-specific fire accident scenarios. 6. Uses updated methodology for tornado missile stability calculations for freestanding HI-STORMs and HI-TRACs (transfer casks) and clarifies the weights to be used for varying heights of HI-TRACs. 7. Adds the new MPC-44, with continuous basket shim (CBS) and to hold 44 pressurized-water reactor fuel assemblies of certain 14x14 fuel class. It is to be used with HI-STORM FW System Version E and UVH overpacks. 8. Adds the new MPC-37P, with CBS and to hold 37 pressurized-water reactor fuel assemblies of certain 15x15 fuel class. It is to be used with Version E overpack. 9. Adds HI-DRIP ancillary system, which is an optional ancillary system designed to prevent water within the MPC while loaded in the HI-TRAC from boiling during loading and unloading operations. 10. Includes the ability to use computational fluid dynamics analysis to evaluate site-specific burial-under-debris accident scenarios. 11. Includes the ability to use water without glycol in the HI-TRAC water jacket during transfer operations below 32 [deg]F based on the site specific MPC total heat loads. 12. Adds new 10x10J fuel type to approved content in the HI-STORM FW System. 13. Updates bounding fuel variables for 8x8F and 11x11A boiling-water reactor fuel types in CoC appendix B. 14.

On July 18, 1990, the NRC amended 10 CFR part 72 to provide for the storage of spent fuel under a general license in cask designs approved by the NRC. The EA for the 1990 final rule analyzed the potential environmental impacts of using NRC-approved storage casks. The EA for the HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System, CoC No. 1032, Amendment No. 1, Revision No. 1, published in 2015, tiers off of the EA issued for the July 18, 1990, final rule. 'Tiering' off earlier EAs is a standard process encouraged by the regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) that entails the use of impact analyses of previous EAs to bound the impacts of a proposed action where appropriate. The Holtec HI-STORM FW MPC Storage System is designed to mitigate the effects of design basis accidents that could occur during storage. Considering the specific design requirements for the accident conditions, the design of the cask would prevent loss of containment, shielding, and criticality control. If there is no loss of containment, shielding, or criticality control, the environmental impacts would not be significant."

                "The NRC staff considered the potential impacts of the proposed action on land use, historical and cultural resources; visual and scenic resources; meteorology, climatology, and air quality; noise; geology and soils; water resources; ecological resources; socioeconomics; public and occupation health; transportation and traffic; environmental justice; and waste management. The Decommissioning Generic Environmental Impact Statement (GEIS) (NUREG-0586) generically addressed many of the potential environmental impacts of decommissioning at the FCS. During its review of the FCS LTP, the NRC concluded that the impacts for most resource areas--onsite land use; water resources; air quality; ecology, not including threatened and endangered species or outside the operational area; socioeconomics; historic and cultural resources within the operational area; aesthetics; noise; transportation; and nonradioactive waste management--were still bounded by the Decommissioning GEIS. Therefore, the NRC does not expect impacts associated with these issues beyond those discussed in the GEIS, which concluded that the impact level for these issues was SMALL."
