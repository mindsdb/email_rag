If symptoms are present, they can\neasily be mistaken for a common cold or the flu because of their similarities.\n\nAccording to the health agency, the main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,\ncoughing, difficulty breathing, and pneumonia in both lungs. In severe cases,\nthe illness can even result in death.\n\nThe World Health Organization lists additional symptoms that have been\ndocumented in some COVID-19 patients, including tiredness, aches and pains,\nsore throat, diarrhea, nausea and runny nose.\n\nGorfinkel said clinicians can\u2019t distinguish between the illnesses based on\nsymptoms alone. She said they can all present the same way, which is why the\npatient\u2019s travel history or history of exposure to the virus is so important\nin determining whether someone might have COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe do not have the facilities or the tests to test absolutely everybody, so\nthat history of travel if you\u2019re basically otherwise well, that\u2019s a critical\npart of it,\u201d she explained.",
