There is also no information provided with regards to grouping. Coda supports formulas and grouping and these columns will just need to be updated post import.\n\n\n\nWhat about my automations?\n--------------------------\n\n\n\nAutomations are also not exported from Airtable\u2019s API. Luckily Coda has Automations as well that can be quickly created by using the /automations command\n\n\n\nCan I import Airtable interfaces?\n---------------------------------\n\n\n\nAirtable doesn\u2019t provide a way to export interfaces, so we currently import them into Coda docs. Since Coda is an all-in-one doc, you can present information in any way you see fit. You can mix and match tables, views, and rich content, right in the Canvas. If you want to know more, a good place to start is our guide on creating a visually impactful doc.\n\n\n\nHow do Airtable concepts translate to Coda concepts?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAirtable has Workspaces, Bases, Tables and Views. Coda has similar concepts for these behaviors. A workspace in Coda holds a list of Coda docs. We translate Airtable Bases to a Coda doc. A Coda doc seamlessly combines the database capabilities of Airtable tables, views and much more in a flexible surface.\n\n\n\nInterfaces in Airtable are replaced by Coda docs. Since a Coda doc is a flexible writing surface you can mix and match tables, views, and rich content in the Canvas.\n\n\n\nWhy is my Airtable import taking so long to complete?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThere is rate limiting on the Airtable API that limits the number of calls we can make per second. We can only pull 100 records at a time and thus it may take some time to complete an import that has many rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---"

                "**FAQs**\n========\n\n\nWhat happens to formulas, rollups, and grouping when importing into Coda?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nUnfortunately Airtable does not provide any information on the specific formulas used in formula or rollup fields. There is also no information provided with regards to grouping. Coda supports formulas and grouping and these columns will just need to be updated post import.\n\n\n\nWhat about my automations?\n--------------------------\n\n\n\nAutomations are also not exported from Airtable\u2019s API. Luckily Coda has Automations as well that can be quickly created by using the /automations command\n\n\n\nCan I import Airtable interfaces?\n---------------------------------\n\n\n\nAirtable doesn\u2019t provide a way to export interfaces, so we currently import them into Coda docs. Since Coda is an all-in-one doc, you can present information in any way you see fit. You can mix and match tables, views, and rich content, right in the Canvas. If you want to know more, a good place to start is our guide on creating a visually impactful doc.\n\n\n\nHow do Airtable concepts translate to Coda concepts?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nAirtable has Workspaces, Bases, Tables and Views. Coda has similar concepts for these behaviors. A workspace in Coda holds a list of Coda docs. We translate Airtable Bases to a Coda doc. A Coda doc seamlessly combines the database capabilities of Airtable tables, views and much more in a flexible surface.\n\n\n\nInterfaces in Airtable are replaced by Coda docs. Since a Coda doc is a flexible writing surface you can mix and match tables, views, and rich content in the Canvas.\n\n\n\nWhy is my Airtable import taking so long to complete?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThere is rate limiting on the Airtable API that limits the number of calls we can make per second. We can only pull 100 records at a time and thus it may take some time to complete an import that has many rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---"

To open these settings, click on the **Insert** tab in the upper right corner of your doc, then search the Pack name, click on the Pack, and then click into **Settings.** Here you\u2019ll find the **Default refresh rate**.

First, check that your Pack is installed and your connection is working by clicking the Insert icon (upper right corner of the doc), then searching for the Pack you\u2019re troubleshooting. More on checking the connection of your Pack here.\n\n\n\nNext, make sure the link you\u2019re pasting actually corresponds to the format of the column. For example, the Spotify Pack offers three column formats: **Album**, **Track** and **Playlist**. The **Album** column will only work with links to *albums*, the **Track** column will only work with links to *tracks*, and so on. Links often contain a hint as to the format of their referenced data in the URL (e.g. the link *open.spotify.com/album/*.... refers to an album and should be pasted into a column of format **Album**).\n\n\n\nHow are these Pack URL columns different from Pack sync tables?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPack sync tables automatically bring in sets of data from the 3rd party tool based on the filter criteria you set for the sync. Coda will search the available data and pull in any and all rows that match the criteria of your sync settings.\n\n\n\nPack URL columns, on the other hand, allow you to manually curate whichever pieces of data you want to include in your table.\n\n\n\n\n\n---"

Coda will search the available data and pull in any and all rows that match the criteria of your sync settings.\n\nOn the other hand, Pack URL columns allow you to manually curate whichever pieces of data you want to include in your table.

For example, the Spotify Pack offers three column formats: **Album**, **Track** and **Playlist**. The **Album** column will only work with links to *albums*, the **Track** column will only work with links to *tracks*, and so on. Links often contain a hint as to the format of their referenced data in the URL (e.g. the link *open.spotify.com/album/*.... refers to an album and should be pasted into a column of format **Album**).\n\n\n\nHow are these Pack URL columns different from Pack sync tables?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPack sync tables automatically bring in sets of data from the 3rd party tool based on the filter criteria you set for the sync. Coda will search the available data and pull in any and all rows that match the criteria of your sync settings.\n\n\n\nPack URL columns, on the other hand, allow you to manually curate whichever pieces of data you want to include in your table.\n\n\n\n\n\n---"
            ],
            "reference_answer": "If you pasted a link into a Pack column format and nothing happened, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot. First, you should check that your Pack is installed and your connection is working. You can do this by clicking the Insert icon located in the upper right corner of the document, then searching for the Pack you're troubleshooting.\n\nNext, you need to ensure that the link you're pasting matches the format of the column. For instance, if you're using the Spotify Pack, it offers three column formats: Album, Track, and Playlist. The Album column will only work with links to albums, the Track column will only work with links to tracks, and so on. The format of the link is crucial because links often contain a hint as to the format of their referenced data in the URL. For example, the link 'open.spotify.com/album/' refers to an album and should be pasted into a column of format Album. \n\nSo, the format of the column and the link is very important in this context as it determines whether the pasted link will work or not. If the formats do not match, the link will not work as expected.",
